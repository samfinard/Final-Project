Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3

And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes
Ima ball today, wake up, then go ball some more
Can't tell a grown man what to do with his
It's your prerogative Ima mind my biz
But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like
(x2)

Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinking bout sleep
Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)
[Hook]

Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033
It's my son's birthday my boy turned 3, and looking at him is like looking at me
Can't look back and watch the moves I make
But the moves that I made fuck around and move me

Live Like We're Dying,Kris Allen,"{'2010-01-09': 32, '2010-01-02': 33}","8 ContributorsLive Like We’re Dying Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say ""I love you"" enough?
'Til it's to late
It's not too late

[Verse 2]
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs, yeah
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud

Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone, just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong, but you already know

Believe me, I won't stop at nothin'
To see you, so I've started runnin'

They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll

Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

In the middle of the night

And you tell me 'bout your dreams

Well, you could try sleeping in my bed
Lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me?
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky, I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love

Think it's not going to stay anyway, think it's overrated
For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out

The stars lean down to kiss you
And I lie awake and miss you
Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
'Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly
But I'll miss your arms around me
I'd send a postcard to you, dear
'Cause I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I'll watch the night turn light blue
But it's not the same without you
Because it takes two to whisper quietly
The silence isn't so bad
'Til I look at my hands and feel sad
'Cause the spaces between my fingers
Are right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
But drenched in vanilla twilight
I'll sit on the front porch all night
Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you
I don't feel so alone

[Bridge]
I don't feel so alone
I don't feel so alone
As many times as I blink, I'll think of you
Tonight (Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I'll think of you tonight

And heavy wings grow lighter
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again
And I'll forget the world that I knew
But I swear I won't forget you
Oh, if my voice could reach back through the past
I'd whisper in your ear
""Oh darling, I wish you were here""

Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?

I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser

They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know

And establishin' a name as he goes

You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends

Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be

So this is how it ends
This is where it all goes down
This is what ""I don't love you"" feels like
It ain't the middle of the night
And it ain't even raining outside
It ain't exactly what I had in mind, for goodbye

[Chorus]
At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down
On a Sunday in the sunshine
At a red light

[Verse 2]
I thought she was gonna say
Something 'bout that couple kids and crossing the street
Or something about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said ""it's over"", didn't try to lie or pick a fight
I might have seen it coming that way

[Chorus]
But at a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothing to say, don't even try
Some are coming home, some are leaving town
While my world's crashing down

I'm Going In,Drake Featuring Lil Wayne & Young Jeezy,"{'2010-01-09': 69, '2010-01-02': 97}","1 ContributorBetter Dayz Review LyricsDuring my eighth grade year, I was digging through my parents’ old boxes when I discovered 2Pac Shakur’s Better Dayz album, this still-intact two-disc CD case. From that day, Better Dayz was everywhere with me, as I also had a CD player to listen to this album (uncovered in the box as well). In this current age of iPods and MP3s, of 2 Chainz and Drake, I had an ancient device that I valued like a diamond in the rough, obsessed over an album my peers knew or cared nothing for (When I was an eighth grader, I obviously had a wild social life)

I didn’t care. Sure, I listened to and loved rappers (Post-Blueprint Jay-Z, Eminem, T.I., and (regrettably) Lil Wayne), but Better Dayz was the first album I cherished, sparking a deeper passion for music than I once possessed. It would be disgraceful for me to not review this album before any other because, without this, I would have little love for rap (if at all). Without further delay, here’s my track-by-track review of Better Dayz.

Disc 1

1. Intro – This is the best way to begin an album. A reporter is at the unveiling of Better Dayz and she wonders where the songs are coming from since, you know, Pac was dead and all when this album was made. The fans in the background chant “Tu-Pac! Tu-Pac!” before they all count down the seconds for the release of Better Dayz.

2. Still Ballin’ – This is the first official song on the album, and it’s a mediocre one, lasting under three minutes, possessing a good-but-not-great beat, and featuring a rapper named Trick Daddy. Really? This is what the fans were hyped up about?

3. When We Ride On Our Enemies – Okay, this is a little better, with a beat that lets you know something amazing is about to happen, but (like “Still Ballin”) it’s under three minutes and is a mediocre song overall. Right now, the best thing about Better Dayz is the intro

4. Changed Man – Wow. This. Is. Amazing. The guitar instrumental is awesome, giving a laid-back mood to the song. Johntá Austin, this no-name singer, provides a phenomenal chorus while 2Pac and T.I. (the King of the South) trade verses about how they’re, well, “changed men”. This song is easily a highlight of Better Dayz.

5. F**k ‘Em All – And now we’re back to crap. Oh yeah, it also featured Outlawz, the duo that appeared in “Me Against the World”

6. Never B Peace – Hey, this song ain’t half bad (and the beat’s pretty good, too). As I look at whose featured (some nobodies named E.D.I and Kastro), I realize this was a lot better than I expected it to be

7. Mama’s Just A Little Girl – When people think of Pac’s classic ballads to the ladies, they’ll think of “Dear Mama” but this song was pretty good too. “Mama’s Just A Little Girl” has a soulful edge to it and 2Pac raps with passion on this track, but it’s Kimma Hill who dampens the songs brightness as she delivers a very unsatisfying chorus (there’s a reason why nobody’s heard of her). This is definitely no “Dear Mama”

8. Street Fame – Not many would attribute 2Pac’s legendary success to his lyricism or wordplay but, in this track, Shakur simply obliterated the mic (“Positive identification/ Got me rushed to the station”), and rappers should really collaborate more with Daz Dillinger (the producer who made this song’s beat) because he is a BEAST. Just listen to this sick piano instrumental for yourself. I’m ignoring that this song was from the `94 album Thug Life Vol. 1 to say “Street Fame” is one of Better Dayz’s finest tracks. As Pac said in this song “Lyrics’ll leave you spellbound.” They sure did

9. Whatcha Gonna Do? – You know what I’m going to do? Skip this song. Hey, thanks for asking

10. Fair XChange – At first, I hated this track but it slowly grew on me. As for the song itself, it’s one of 2Pac’s typical tracks dedicated to the ladies
You might also like11. Late Night – 2Pac ripped apart this song’s phenomenal beat, easily the best beat I’ve heard in this album

12. Ghetto Star – I can’t think of a more stereotypical song title and I can’t think of two more non-sensical stage names than this track’s guest rapper and producer (Nutt-So and Go-Twice, respectively). Because of this, I assume I’ll be listening to absolute garbage. Instead, I receive this intense instrumental accompanied by a super-serious Shakur, who once again brandished his lyrical excellence, providing an in-depth explanation of his struggles

13. Thugz Mansion (Acoustic) – I never understood what was so great about this. Yeah, there are some good aspects to this song (the beautiful guitar instrumental, and Nas spitting fire), but 2Pac’s rhymes were stolen form the original and J.Phoenix submitted a very sub-par chorus. It is what it is: a good-but-not-great rendition of a hip-hop classic (which will be in Disc 2)

(End of Disc 1)

Disc 2

1. My Block – This extraordinary guitar instrumental is present as 2Pac describes the struggles of the ghettos and he looks beyond that for hope. There’s also this group of little kids who form a first-class chorus. Disc 2 is definitely on a great start

2. Thugz Mansion – Over the years, I’ve listened to tons and tons of excellent songs, but this is still my all-time favorite. “Thugz Mansion” begins with Pac inventing the idea of a heaven for thugs like him, which leads into this masterpiece. To me, the beat isn’t that impressive but that’s the one flaw I found. On ‘Thugz Mansion”, 2Pac flaunts his lyrical excellence and injects his rhymes with unbridled passion. There’s also a notable rhyme in Verse 2 where Shakur says “Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us/ They’d rather see us locked in chains, please explain why they can’t stand us”, an idea that Kanye West expounded upon in his well-known song “New Slaves”. And don’t get me started on R&B legend Anthony Hamilton, who explodes into this track with an unrivaled chorus. If you’re going to listen to one song on Better Dayz, this is it (As an eighth grader, I pushed the repeat button so often that it broke)

3. Never Call You B**ch Again – It’s another excellent guitar instrumental, and Pac once again steps up his game. This song is about the rap legend gaining a newfound appreciation for the special woman who stood by him through thick and thin. Tyrese Gibson, who’s currently known as “that black guy” in the Fast and Furious franchise, is featured in this track and, while he’s definitely no Anthony Hamilton, he provides an amazing chorus. Disc 2 of Better Dayz is 3-for-3; there are no crappy tracks or sub-par songs as of right now

4. Better Dayz – The streak continues. The title track features a great chorus by Ron Isley, a soothing, reminiscing beat, and a spectacular Shakur (whose emotional performances on this album have become the norm). “Better Dayz” is a superb song all-around

5. U Can Call – We’re now 5-for-5! “U Can Call” is definitely a standout track in Better Dayz, a laid-back song about picking up women that features a phenomenal beat, the second-best beat on Better Dayz (“Late Night”, of course, is first), and an equally excellent chorus by Jazze Pha

6. Military Minds – The streak ends. I’m not saying this was a bad song. Actually, it was an awesome song with an amazing beat but “Military Minds” died when 2Pac continuously chanted “Where my thugs at”

7. Fame – The good times return. With the same song title as Young Jeezy’s immortal track (and the one great Snowman song I could find), this no-name producer (Hurt M Badd) creates a great beat as 2Pac and Outlawz tears it to bits. “Fame” also approaches a level of emotion that reminiscent of Disc 2’s earlier tracks as the pirate chant-like hook begins the song with “One thing we all adore/ Something worth dying for/ Nothing but pain/ Stuck in this game/ Searching for fortune and fame” (This song is one of Better Dayz’s finest, but I really want more from Pac)

8. Fair XChange (remix) – My ears are bleeding. This is by far the worst song Better Dayz has to offer, a much more insufferable track than “Whatcha Gonna Do?”, and that’s something nearly impossible to pull off. Skip this song
9. Catchin’ Feelins – Produced by E.D.I (the same guy who featured in “Never B Peace”), this track’s beat sounds suspiciously similar to the one in “Ghetto Star”. Overall, this is a pretty good song, nothing special (and it also features Outlawz)

10. There U Go – A laid-back song reminiscent of “Changed Man” and “Late Night”, this track is about Pac catching his woman cheating on him and how he feels about it. Big Syke (who collaborated with Pac on “All Eyez On Me”) is featured in here along with Outlawz, who surprisingly fit the mood of “There U Go” and temporarily resign from their usually intense rhymes

11. This Life I Lead – You can take one look at the song title and know exactly what this track is about. Like “Fame”, 2Pac inserts a single verse, a very good verse but still one verse, and delivers a mediocre hook. Also in this song is Outlawz (shocker), who steal 2Pac’s immortal line: “I ain’t a killa, but don’t push me.” Not one of Better Dayz’s finest

12. Who Do U Believe In? – Over the last couple of tracks, I wanted 2Pac to take over, to simply dominate, and he does on this one. Over the simplistic guitar instrumental, Pac gets deep, discussing religion on a level I haven’t heard since “Thugz Mansion”. Yaki Kadafi (an Outlawz member) makes an appearance and his mediocricy as a rapper, sort of obvious throughout this album, is on full display here. Despite the fact that “Who Do U Believe In?” was originally from the `99 compilation album Suge Knight Represent: Chronic 2000, this is a very good track in Better Dayz.

13. They Don’t Give A F**k About Us – The previous song would’ve been a great way to finish this album; instead, we’re stuck with this. Sure, this track’s theme was a deep one, about what happens when people die and if others will care about them, but overall it was a very second-rate song

14. Outro – Only thirteen seconds long, this is 2Pac saying he’ll come back from the dead and he says this twice. (End of Disc 2)

Conclusion

Everybody loved 2Pac, but when he died, they dismissed the albums that were released after that, claiming the posthumous albums were either not as good as the ones when he was alive or were copied material from Pac’s previous works. That might be true for the other posthumous albums but Better Dayz, with the exception of a few songs, is entirely original and this album, as a whole, is just as good as the ones Shakur created when he was alive

Don’t judge me, but honestly I was having (very small) doubts about whether or not 2Pac really is the greatest. Listening to Better Dayz crushed those doubts to smithereens and now I can continue to scream my loyalty to 2Pac Shakur, the one and only king of rap (R.I.P)

Todo de branco, com a sua calça, homеm adulto com a calça baixa
Tudo que você está dizendo parece bom para mim
Não existe necessidade de me convencer mais
Arrogante, é verdade, uma lâmina é apertada
E eu sinto seu perfume no ar
Baby, você está fazendo algo certo
Você acabou de cancelar todos os outros homens aqui
Você diz que a ama minha bolsa, e da cor das minhas unhas
Você pode ver que eu estou indo
Eu quero ter certeza que você vai se lembrar de mim
Então, eu vou deixar o meu número no seu videofone

Eu sei exatamente o que estou querendo
Se vai ser você e eu

You hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums; oh, look
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'

My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts

Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like ""Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula""
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

He'd say, ""What if you went platinum?"", I'd just laugh at him
""That's not happening, that I can't fathom""
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 1]
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
That's a no-no, even she knows Da-Da's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking-A, B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep up on ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen, man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters, turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I oughta just be honest, but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof

[Verse 2]
""Sorry, Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots""
All these fucking voices in my head, I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
Together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away, some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheiße, ask Doctor Dreson
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away, son
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today, son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stain, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it
[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre

I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 3]
Elevator in my house, hah, smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in the microwave, I'm
Thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbors step away, then I just pepper-sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hide out, drive by my house and beep
Like, now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down, fucker (Bah), try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out why now there's beef
Mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling ""Stop!""
[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre

You fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A, even got a bidet
To wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it, the shit's awesome
Yeah, fucking elevator

Empire State Of Mind (Part II) Broken Down,Alicia Keys,{'2010-01-02': 55},"39 ContributorsEmpire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down Lyrics[Intro]
Ooooh, New York
Ooooh, New York

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seein' my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on Broadway

[Hook 1]
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby, I'm from New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

[Verse 2]
On the avenue, there ain't ever a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a meltin' pot, on the corner sellin' rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams

These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York

[Bridge]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
""Yeah, yeah! Yeah, yeah!""

[Hook 3]
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do

Hell Breaks Loose,Eminem Featuring Dr. Dre,{'2010-01-02': 29},"77 ContributorsHell Breaks Loose Lyrics[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D.R.E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate, you, busters, must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery

[Chorus: Eminem & Nikki Grier]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose (Hoo!)
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a statement no matter what we do (Yeah!)
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose (Come on!)
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose (Hoo!)
You might also like[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
This is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something, you think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D.R.E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know, I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth?
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

[Chorus: Eminem & Nikki Grier]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose (Yeah!)
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a statement no matter what we do (Oh!)
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose (Come on!)
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose (Hoo!)
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know you're feeling discouraged, but, homie, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm finna blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's three-o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
E and hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

[Chorus: Eminem & Nikki Grier]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose (Hoo!)
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a statement no matter what we do (Yeah!)
