The project was to predict DJIA closing prices using popular song lyrics, New York Times articles, and trending Google searches. Our timespan was 2017-2021 and our region of focus was America.

The NYT articles were obtained through the NYT public API, and the trending Google searches were obtained from https://trends.google.com/trends/.
