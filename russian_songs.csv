Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosy
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it

Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started

After all the shit I did
Look at how they repaying me back

Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checking in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turning off my phone for the night now, baby
Pouring out my soul and it might sound crazy

On 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em
And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
Or being the recievin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hunnid percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull the
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha"

2/8/2020,Unaccommodating,Eminem Featuring Young M.A,"Oh, this what we doin'? Alright (M.A.)
I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (she came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
That's the broke lingo (huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (hello)
Disrespect your life and I'm in gang mode (grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (huh)
I'm in cake mode (huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (brrr)
Collect pesos (huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (hey)
When the pain leaves (huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the Backwood is where the flame goes (there)
To the sky is where my brain goes (wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (what?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed
Game over, Thanos on you H-Os
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (yeah)
Get the plunger (plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three SWATs
Or police officers at least to pull me off of it
And I don't stop
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit
'Cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards
Who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic
It'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim
Better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple and I'm giving it to anyone
Who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me
Is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins
I'm God and the Lord forgives
Even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone
When you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube
And The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music
The more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling, ""bombs away, "" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting
Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (fuck you), I'm unaccommodating
Man, I don't see why they hate me
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy
They call me Kanye crazy
""APESHIT, "" Beyonce, Jay-Z
And I'm back with Andre, baby
And the doctor's operating
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K.Dot to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect
I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet
Now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo Kim put her lips
All the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you
I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal that as a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapse
Here comes Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (fuck you), I'm unaccommodating"
