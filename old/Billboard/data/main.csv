Easy On Me,Adele,"There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me


There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on mÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me",83

Bad Habits,Ed Sheeran,"(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ, it's true

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far


My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you


Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say

Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now


Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now


You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye


Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out


Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

Save Your Tears,The Weeknd,"Ooh
Na-na, yeah


I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye


I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away


You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care


I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away


Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)


I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time


I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away


Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better


Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)


I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

Save your tears for another day

Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true


Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city


And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid


You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)

(Ah)

Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)


One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)


Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it


One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha

And you'll never get over what you can't understand
Pissed off, hanging up the telephone
Forever ain't far, I'm heading home
Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Last time you ever gonna find me gone
And I, I'll never let you go again

So why are you always angry?
Why are you always quiet?
Why do you sleep alone
When I know you don't like it?
Maybe you might be different
Will it kill you to tell me the truth?

(That's Vade on the keys)
Niggas dyin', fallin' stars through the night
And I been thinkin' 'bout you every night
If you happy, I know that I should be alright
'Cause this tragic and I can't seem for to decide


And I think I just, I should leave, I just
Should I leave it 'lone? I
Should I try or just? I can't lie, I just
I be wantin' for to cry
But I'm caught up with these hoes, they gon' follow
Ballin' like a baller blocker
Every time I catch my feelings, lock 'em in a bottle
And you probably find my heart somewhere lost in Nevada (In Nevada)


Don't know who I want, you the one I want, oh
Never said I don't, that's that money talk, oh (Talk)
Drunker than a skunk, it go down in the room (Down)
ChoppÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµrs in the trunk, baby, this that slime tune
But I need your lovÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ like right now, baby, ooh (Ooh)
I'm not on no drugs, not right now, it's the truth (Truth)
I apologize for you lookin' like a fool (Sorry)
I can't hold you right now, so I been holdin' on my tool
I don't want my ex, I don't want no bitch I had (Don't)
I just want a chance, hopefully I make you glad (DonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt)
If you turn me down, tell the truth, I just might spazz (Spazz)
If who around laugh, I just probably bust they ass (Bust they ass)

And I think I just, I should leave, I just
Should I leave it 'lone? I
Should I try or just? I can't lie, I just
I be wantin' for to cry
But I'm caught up with these hoes, they gon' follow
Ballin' like a baller blocker
Every time I catch my feelings, lock 'em in a bottle
And you probably find my heart somewhere lost in Nevada (In Nevada)",73

Champagne Poetry,Drake,"I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll


I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are high still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the

I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll


Champagne poetry, these are the effortless flows, supposedly
Something else is controlling me
Under her pictures live some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me, I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money
Nigga, I'm wilding with your bread, you owe it to me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I don't have to second-guess nothing with no one I love
'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much
Think I got to scale the love back 'cause


I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean



Yeah, oh
Heavy day
For real
Yeah
Yeah


The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore

Like they played that song just to see you sway
Like that old surf shop had you in mind
With what you got on, makin' those tan lines
It's like the ocean knows we're layin'
On this beach tonight
It's like the sand's been waitin'
For you to come alive 'cause


You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
Were made for lightin' this July sky up

Flyer then a jet, baby, flyer than an eagle (Brr, brr)
Can I take you out tonight? Go get somethin' to eat
Sit and I'll tell you like, things you don't know 'bout me
I'm like, ""Bae, my grandma died, I was at a sleepover""
I'm like, ""Bae, I could have died that night, my whip had flipped over""

Now I got grams like I'm Frank Matthews, jewelry wÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµigh at least a kilo
Now I'm back to you, every timÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ that I'm in it like a pool, she be wet inside
Tryna hit it like I want, but then I don't 'cause I be too high
Feel it's best if I let you decide, 'cause this, I don't wanna jeopardize
Come lay me down every day I'm tired
Fuck these hoes 'cause they be tellin' lies
Now I need a blueprint, is you all in? (All, all)
I just gotta know, gotta know
Drugs got my mind clickin'
On my Kawasaki, tryna do a heel clicker
Down and out, got me feeling suicidal, oh
Air Force 1, they're custom-made (Custom-made)
I'ma pull up, thirty thousand dollar Balmain jeans (Balmain jeans)
Pull up with that blicky and it's tucked just like 'em beams
Damn, she don't like no dogs, but hangin' wit' a snake
Told her, ""Motherfuck the blogs, just do what Top say""
Is it real, is it fake? I don't know, I can't tell
I'm just hopin' time worth it, I'm just hopin' we don't fail
I'm just tryna hold on, looks disguised, can't prevail
Insecure, feel like I ain't worth ya, not enough for none of them
Ooh-ooh, do you hear me calling? Right now, full of indo
Thirty minutes later, probably be outside your window
Throwin' rocks until you turn your light on and say, ""Go home""
Don't know what the fuck is goin' on, were you expectin' me to go?
Fuck it, let me pack my clothes, right back to that murder zone
Fuck, I miss my granddad home, shouldn't have came up off the porch
Feel that I'm gon' die out here, all alone and by myself

Alive, got breath on life support
Alive, got breath on life support
I said all my pain keep me goin', your love keep me calm
They gon' take it once they pull the cord
I call that life on life support (Ooh)
They don't respect me no more, they don't love me no more
They ain't feelin' my songs, take my kids during the storm
They all gone, they done took my life support


I'm with the gang, on the block, in the trenches
I take you shoppin', alone up in Lenox
Take you to Shyne and flood your pendant
And spend straight dimes like fuck them pennies
She's a hypnotizin' demon-lover, so satanic
I say black, now I take that rock from metal
Demonic, so dynamic
Straight from the block, on that bitch in a foreign, I'ma swerve
I ain't worried, I won't panic
Yeah, I was born and made it out, so here, I should lay down
A girl to make me settle down, but I can't
I drop you off at mom's house
While me and my cousins try to take rank, bust brains
Catch one lack, hop out, take aim
God forbid if them niggas shoot back, and luckily just hit my brain
If I don't go in, Lord, please have mercy, know that she gon' go insane
Mistreat a nigga, leave me, then they act like I'm the one to blame

Alive, got breath on life support
Alive, got breath on life support
I said all my pain keep me goin', your love keep me calm
They gon' take it once they pull the cord
I call that life on life support
They don't respect me no more, they don't love me no more

(Winning lottery numbers coming up)


I can't quit at all, at all
I ain't hurt (I ain't hurt, nigga) at all, at all
On my soul, at all, at all
Stay the same as my pain grow, ridin' 'round with my bros (This is the sound)


Ridin' in the Maybach, let's go
Ten M's up, nigga, let's go
He a dreadhead, mhm, my bro leave him dead in front that store
On three different drugs tryna take away my pain, but it's still gon' flow
Try my hardest to put a smile on top my mans, but he still can't cope


On the highway, out the window, do somethin'
Need it my way, bam, bam, shoot somethin'
He a head hunter rude boy, trust nothin'
She got a nice round bum, but can't pay her nothin'
Do a hit real sick, it be cold the wholÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ summer
I can't figure how she comin', I'ma givÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ her to my mama
Any minute, I'ma cut a nigga, knowin' I'ma slime him
Everything goin' bad, you can trust him, still time him
Niggas steady reppin', we be shootin' at the bitch
Sound of the stick goin' boom when it hit
Sound of the smoke, real loud when it's lit
Still let it off with a crowd in the midst
Black card, matte stick, I'm it
Don't pick die if you try one trick
Right gang, but she say, ""Wrong bitch""
Young rich nigga, he done took the wrong fix
Overdose, can't shake back, no
Harbor freight, get the jack from the store
White trace, that's a whole lotta snow
Ridin' bumpin' Kirk with a .30 and a pole
With a young bitch, she don't want me, it's vivid
But I don't need her hand when I'm runnin' up Benji's
Real deal business, this real Blood business
Really spill those, dead bodies in the trenches
Real slime, that was my partner for a minute
Contract from my brother when them hollows got up in it
Dodgin' bullets in the car when them shottas sent them in it
All praise to Allah, one was dead in less than sixty
We gon' burn them forensics, leave 'em dead if he miss it
Should have aimed when you shot it, don't fuck with my bodies
I'ma foreign my engine, take luxury narcotics
Why they cookin'? I'm watchin', die protectin' that body
Through the house, the aroma, it cover the closet
I don't say that ain't it, but I still wan' cop it
I'ma flood out this bitch to whoever come cop it
Police ran in this bitch, no one say nothin' about it
I ain't got nothin' I wanna do better with my life, but take narcotics with my life
Collect these bodies with your life, send it to the Most Highest
Nigga showin' off, got it took when he got it
Nigga ran off, tell me what you doin' 'bout it?
You don't know off the dome shit, can't write
With the Glock when you see the kid, on sight
Bullets started playin' 'round with tension, got focused
Got another pack rolled up, he gon' smoke it
Ten grand, twenty grand, all night scope
We're up all day high, we're up all day slow

I can't quit at all, at all
I ain't hurt at all, at all
On my soul, at all, at all
Stay the same as my pain grow, ridin' 'round with my bros


Ridin' in the Maybach, let's go
Ten M's up, nigga, let's go
He a dreadhead, mhm, my bro leave him dead in front that store
On three different drugs tryna take away my pain, but it's still gon' flow
Try my hardest to put a smile on top my mans, but he still can't cope


Herm steady talkin' 'bout, ""Top, just let me shoot him,"" no
I can't teach a nigga shit, I can make it out him
I ain't need no tutor, been advanced for the road
Doped up, two or three tools, doin' shows
Forty on my teeth and two hundred for my pole
Three hundred for my car, extra sneeze for the nose
I be runnin' to the money soon as it reach my phone
I ain't got nothin' I wanna do better with my life, but take narcotics with my life
Collect these bodies with your life, send it to the Most Highest
Nigga showin' off, got it took when he got it
Nigga ran off, tell me what you doin' 'bout it?
You don't know off the dome shit, can't write

When I start stressin', I get bored, might spend a million, that shit tickle
On a threeway, me and Slow, he caught L's and we both pick 'em
In the cell but you can't tell that we in the jail
'Cause we don't feel no pain unless them kids say in vain that I miss you
If you my dawg, I'm tryna put you on the shit that I'm on
Super drippy, made the Patek match the kicks I got on

Made her text her best friend, she said, ""He Christian Dior""
And the crazy part about it, there wasn't shit in the yard
Shit, I been winnin' a long time, I know they sick of me, y'all
Got me switchin' up my flow again, switchin' up my hoe again
E'rrybody been changin', got me switchin' up my bro again

Shit, how you think we always end up bein' in y'all bitches?
This is the same feelin' that you get like when you a kid on Christmas
I just knocked down a lil' celeb' and I was on her hit list
And I ain't been rappin', I been trappin', tryna learn my business
They thought I fell off, but they well off
I gotta keep my name worth more than money and gold
Remain humble around my people 'cause I don't spoil my soul
And I keep my dreams before fame and all these funny lil' hoes
'Cause I got two sons that's kings and they like three lil' bros
And they want everything they cop, I order them clothes
Gotta watch for everything, that dot'll spoil your ghost
And I be partyin' with people that got the word of control
'Cause they know I got the influence you can feel in your soul
This is culture currency, money shit don't ever worry me
Gotta have my chopper in front of this bitch, this shit been gettin' embarrassin'
She seen me cuddle with my stick, said, ""Boy, you need some therapy""
And I can't lie, I prolly do, 'cause I still have dreams of niggas airin' me
It ain't no fuckin' fear in me

I'm gettin' everything I aimed for
I'm gettin' everything I aimed for
Bulletproof the Range Rove', niggas be on angles
I done bought so many diamond chains, swear they get tangled
Promise any nigga sayin' my name gon' get mangled (Boom)


Same niggas 'round me gettin' changed and they dangerous
Different colored riches in the pictures, Power Rangers
Come to fuckin' these bitches and gettin' this cash, no, we ain't stainless
Two hundred on the dash, been through the hood like I ain't famous
Sometimes I just be havin' to vent though, I ain't gon' lie
A lot people still left here like
Everybody prayin' I don't go back, but it's like, what you want me to do?
And leave my people?
And I can't leave my people, got that eye of the eagle
My homie wanted the Bentley but he died in the Regal
And I ain't never sell no heroin, auntie died from the needle
If you my opp, my daddy dyin' to meet you
'Cause I know the feeling when you fucked up and you lit
And nobody wan' see you, but when you come up and you rich
Everybody believe you, they use me too, I got useless
Think that's how I got even
Put my life on the line and sacrifice for my people

Put it on my soul, I can put it on my soul
We be goin' to the awards and I ain't puttin' up my pole
That new Virgil and Dior came through, l got it on
Put it on my soul, put it on my soul
Ain't nothin' that I, it ain't nothin' that I can't hold
I'm gettin' everything I aimed for


Yeah, I'm gettin' everything (Everything)
Bulletproof the Range Rove', donut the Durango
Crazy all the shit that I obtain, I feel the same dose
My young nigga died in the streets lettin' his flame go
And I think about it every night 'fore I sleep, it make my brain go

Got me cuddlin' with my Glock when I sleep, can't let my flame go

I seen so many niggas switchin', I had to cut 'em off
So many bitches actin' different, we stopped fuckin' raw
I upped the score, I went for more, shit, I'm like, ""It's up to y'all""
And you ain't gotta talk behind my back, you know my number, call me, mmm
'Cause I heard they said I wasn't feedin' the team
I'm in the studio all night, shit, I'm like, ""What do you mean?""
Shit, all them nights on private flights, feel like we livin' the dream
'Member we said we wouldn't let these bitches get in between
When people told me you was jealous, I just wouldn't believe (Believe)
And when niggas told me you was fuckin', no, I couldn't believe it


I tried to give you all my blessings, but you couldn't receive it
'Cause you was listenin' to people that was listenin' to people
I had to get up and leave you 'cause you couldn't even see it
All this fame, turned into a monster, shit like Resident Evil
And once the love turn toxic, think it's better I don't see you
'Cause I've been runnin' up my millions, shit been revving my ego
I put my money 'fore my bitches so we never get equal
'Cause then the world keep turning, the money keep burning
Living and I'm learning, ain't no bitches I'm concerned with
I seen everybody change on me 'bout some money
Learned to get rich, came home, niggas actin' funny, I can't cut it
I'm just strappin' and I ain't talkin'
Swear to God, none of y'all niggas better not grab for my coffin
Swear to God, bad bitches playing Simon Says when I'm talkin'
And I can't say I'm runnin' them trenches when I ain't walkin'

I seen so many niggas switchin', I had to cut 'em off
So many bitches actin' different, we stopped fuckin' raw
I upped the score, I went for more, shit, I'm like, ""It's up to y'all""
And you ain't gotta talk behind my back, you know my number, call me, mmm
'Cause I heard they said I wasn't feedin' the team

'Member we said we wouldn't let these bitches get in between
When people told me you was jealous, I just wouldn't believe (Believe)
And when niggas told me you was fuckin', no, I couldn't believe it


Yeah, uh
Let me give you some game, how you gon' maintain?
'Cause niggas that hit it talk like bitches and they be saying things
And I know y'all booed up and that's cool, but did you know things change?
And you a good girl, but I seen good girls go play the same game
Turn to bad girls and make niggas rearrange things
And everything just turn into a blame game
Look at it like a watch, she could be a nice watch, you could get a plain Jane
You take that same watch, bust it down, it ain't worth the same thing
But it's gon' shine when the lights hit it, a little bling-bling
You add some diamonds to it, get a little shine into it
But think about it, take a good girl, add some wildin' to it
That's like a bust down Rollie, don't hold no value to it
And now you at the jeweler tryna trade it in
'Cause time is money, gotta watch what you spend
You can't make it again
I've been down this road with too many hoes and I can't take it again
Take me
Take me away, take me away, all my pain expensive
I got people tryna take me out like I ain't help invent 'em
Smell the venom like Baccarat and money on the menu
And I'll never cross nobody that helped me to a million
Why you even finessin'? I wasn't even checkin'
Look at yourself, bitin' the hand that gave you extra
Niggas tryna leave me for dead, but this ain't checkers
I act like I don't notice and then I bring it to your chest up
To the neck up
Aimin' at your head soon as I catch up
Too many millions, social media don't impress us
Too many feelings while I'm rappin', hope I don't mess up

I seen so many niggas switchin', I had to cut 'em off
So many bitches actin' different, we stopped fuckin' raw
I upped the score, I went for more, shit, I'm like, ""It's up to y'all""
And you ain't gotta talk behind my back, you know my number, call me, mmm
'Cause I heard they said I wasn't feedin' the team
I'm in the studio all night, shit, I'm like, ""What do you mean?""

When my life on the line, gotta know that I'm with it

But I see she don't want me like in the beginning
One got hit with the Drac', saw the look in her eye
Blood flew out her body, right then, felt the love

I set my expectations way too high
Yeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night
Angel eyes, but you've been giving me hell all night
I know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all
Just to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights
Why does your ex think we beefin', is that man alright?
That nigga can't even look at me, he fell off twice
And I'm back poppin', I still remember the day I saw you
I was on your ass like back pockets
Niggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?
So much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face
'Cause you're so two-faced, that I don't know which face
You're the reason we'll be going separate ways
You're the reason we cannot communicate
It's not the things you say, it's what you don't say
I'm not in your way, you're in your own way

Arcade,Duncan Laurence,"A broken heart is all that's left

Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

We were always a losing game

Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no ""K, sure""

I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho

You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, ""True, though""
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call ""R.I.P. Nipsey""
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man, fuck a ""Respectfully,"" I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
While you over there tryna impress the nation
Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'
Niggas textin' ""Bro,"" but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases

Tattoo in my face is the mark of truth
Gotta watch what you say when they market you (Huh)
I already predicted this (I already predicted this, huh)
Y'all only witnessed it (Y'all only witnessed it)
Look, got a couple old friends that I'm not really clickin' with
I know they pray that we settle our differences
I pray that they lower all my **** sentences
I got some demons I'm not even dealin' with
They in they feelings, I'm not really feelin' it
And I know some members that gave back they membership
****, you switched up, huh, like how you not feelin' me?
Look, I act like I care, but I don't really care
Now I live in a new buildin' with amenities
I got a new ceilin' with a chimney
I got a few **** wanna finish me
I don't get too friendly with the enemy
You gotta move different when you in the industry, woo, yeah
You gotta move different when you in the industry, huh
You gotta move different when you in the, look
God blessed me with amazing grace (Uh)
She fell in love with my day to day (Uh)
I just want my problems to fade away (Uh)
Man, I'm tired of ****, I need Gatorade
Boy, I got on my feet and I made a name
And I made it a necklace, huh
When you from the bottom and you workin' hard
Just to get to the top, then they gotta respect it
If you got a voice, then you gotta project it
If you got a wrong, then you gotta correct it
If you got a name, then you gotta protect it
If you give me shock, then you gotta electric (Woo)
Tryna live a new life, so I got a new plan that I gotta finesse with (Look, yeah)
'Cause they want me to lose, they ain't part of the Woos
I been tryin' so hard not to move reckless

We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid, kid
Everything we did for the crib did here
FlexinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ with the business trip
Going cray, take some G6 (Ah)
Lit, lit, '76

Take this trip, trip, trip, this, this
This, this, this, this
You all still lit, lit, lit
I'm off the grid, grid, grid, grid
Off the grid, grid, grid, grid


First, it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em ""sorry,"" they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me

We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib


Pray for what folks and them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off His list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib
Some say A-A-Adam could never be bla-a-ack

Single Saturday Night,Cole Swindell,"I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
EveryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂsingleÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂSaturday night
I wasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂkilling time, crushing cans
Trying not toÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcatch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere


SittinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shaking to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin' you donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night


And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, uh, well, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when

Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
ShakinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to a little, shook me all night long

The last time that I'd by a drink for a girl I'd never met before
I wasnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for




Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Look at us even pickin' out a church now

That would be my last single Saturday night?

My last single Saturday",66
We Didn't Have Much,Justin Moore,"Tonka trucks and G.I. Joes
Jumping those hills with Luke and Bo
Plastic cap guns and a swimming hole
Don't get no dirt on your church clothes
Win or lose, we cheer for the Braves
Ten percent in the offering plate
Sunday chicken and a NASCAR race
Sure'd be nice to get back to that place


There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much


Eighteen, left it all behind
Chasing a girl, chasing a dime
Went so far tryna get mine
I can't see that old porch light
That led me home at night


There was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
When we didn't have much

I can still hear grandma reading
That red letter Book of John
I can still smell coffee in the kitchen
With ol' Don Williams on


And there was dirt on daddy's clothes
From putting that bacon on mama's stove
Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know
All we had was us
And that little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have much
Had it all when we didn't have much
Little bitty house and a lotta love
We had it all when we didn't have",66

Pray five times a day, so many felonies
Who gon' post my bail? Lord, help me
Hol' up, Donda, I'm with your baby when I touch back road
Told him, ""Stop all of that red cap, we goin' home""
Not me with all of these sins, castin' stones
This might be the return of The Throne (Throne)
Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus
You are not in control of my thesis
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces
Before you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
I can't be controlled with programs and presets
Reset
On my cell, in my cell tonight
Don't have to see you to touch you
This is what braille look like, it's on sight
If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail
We know what Hell look like
Still, it's a hell of a life, yikes

The Remorse,Drake,"Yeah (Huh)
Yeah


Look, me and Lil Sandra bagging CDs in the bubble wrap
People recognize me from the TV, but I'm done with that
People don't wanna see me succeed, this shit come with that
Even when I come back, I don't know if it's me that's gonna be coming back
Soon as I left, I had to make peace with that
Dropped out of school 'cause nobody was teaching that
The Best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at
Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts
Even if they make a movie 'bout us, this shit'll be hard to re-enact
Dislocated shoulder, it's hard to be always reaching back
All these IOU's, it's hard for me to be keeping track
Friends that dedicated they life to just keepin' me intact
Hard to pay 40, pay Noel, pay Niko back
All the nights I needed to vent to someone and CJ sat
All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at
All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed
Or times he had to double back (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I mean, even with his salary, you can't put no prices on that
There is no salary cap, there is no payin' him back, for real
I wonder what it could've been if I had snakes in the mix
Actually, I never wanna know 'cause we made it like this
Shots gotta fly either way, now I make it or miss
Overtime hours all good, we take it in shifts
What would you do if it wasn't this? That's a hard one
The finish line is where I like to pull up and start from
Pain is just a place that I go to get the bars from
Anxiety's a drug that I use to get the job done
Delusional's a space I like to think that I'm far from
My son is the one thing I hate to be apart from
Bet against me, don't know where they getting the odds from
I know that when it's done, I'm going wherever God's from
But I still don't know where I get the calm from
(Where I get the calm from) Yeah

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah (Woah, woah)
Yeah


Look, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied
I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line
And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline
Sometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind
I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time
Like, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?
They've been tryna push a narrative since '09
And they even had my ass convinced a couple times
But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times
Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes
And it's whatever with them niggas on the other side
We got problems we could never really put aside
I cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside
I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die
So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)
My hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off
I'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff
Houses paid off, label paid off
My soul for the money wasn't the trade-off
Unlike most of you boys that fade off
I feel guilty taking some days off
Please don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off
I mean, if you comparin' it to what I really made off with
I'm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off
Trust me it was nothin' light, holmes
They tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home
I know you love me
Can't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on
Unless Kawhi wanna run it back
Other than that, the strings'll be unattached
Certified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that
Y'all music gets watered down, when you love 'em back
And you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters
Said you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard
Oh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more
Soft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it
I'm always tryna rekindle
From the bottom to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?
From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter
To my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter
For the young Gs out here starting from the beginning
Nobody praying for you when you winning, don't forget it (Winning, don't forget it)

Woah, woah, woah-woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah-woah, woah
Woah, woah, ah
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Yeah (Ooh, yeah)
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Hard when it starts to fade away
It's hard when the memories start to fade away
Said its hard when the memories start to fade away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh) So beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah",61
Ok Ok,Kanye West,"Okay, now they got me, wanna rap again

Who said I did what? What did they do?
Why the hell you hatin' so damn hard? Someone must pay you
They don't keep me 'round 'cause I'm straight truth
My dawg locked up, had more home runs than Babe Ruth (Boom)
Had them chickens cleanin' my house, I told them, ""Be of use"" (Brr)
If I see disloyalty, then we gon' cut 'em loose (Yeah)
Havin' my hands 'round her neck, grip tight like a noose (Hee)
Tell you a story with a bad ending 'cause I'm not a Seuss (Yeah, bih')
Passin' 'round **** to the thugs for an immunity boost (Go)
Double cup filled to the top with the serenity juice (Yessir)
Moment of silence, R.I.P to Juice (Yeah, hey)
If they say it's up, it's up, I don't need a truce (Damn)
Everything I do is solely for the broken youth (Sheesh, yes)
I just took her over the mountain with my index (Wow)
She told me to go to Hell like I ain't been yet (Yuh)
And I still put in overtime like I ain't win yet

Okay, okay, I'm not okay (Yuh)
Think they're good, it's not okay
Okay, okay, not okay
Think they're good, get out the way


Yeah, it's been plenty times you closed the door on me
That **** really show me how much you say you a bro to me
Showed you love and you constantly cold-shouldered me
But ain't no goin' back to fixin' up, that's the older me, yeah
I'm done with all the fake ****, I had enough of that, yeah
I done had too many **** stab me in the back (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
They say they with you, but they really puttin' on a act
That's when **** hit the fan and all of a sudden, all the facts show
You gotta chin up and show a **** tough love
Let 'em go without you, just to show 'em what it was
We was so close, you would've thought we was blood
We got the same pain, we come from the mud
I swear this **** make me wanna put my all in it, yeah
You can hear the pain 'cause I put my heart in it, yeah
Most of these **** ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no
Most of these **** ain't real, they don't wanna see me winnin', no


But it's okay, we gon' be okay
Only show up when we cut the cake (Oh, yeah)
Showin' love but we okay (We okay)

You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods


Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow


Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these **** leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

Now here we are
You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts


Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow


Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)

Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (Right on)
One last sparkle to follow",67

Jesus Lord,Kanye West,"Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)


Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I madÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, ""****, stand still"" (Jesus)
""You took my brother life, you made my mother cry"" (Lord)
""Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ""
He said, ""Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ""
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)


Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like ErtuÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In TepoztlÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡n, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, JosÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ© Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)


What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me, it kinda feels like
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids
Have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals
For being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
And it is what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)",59

Forever After All,Luke Combs,"A cold beer's got twelve ounces

You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long


When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all




They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes

One won't have the other by their side

Pure Souls,Kanye West,"Life change when you famous
I remember, back before the chains, we was nameless
Went through stages just to hop on new stages
Open up your eyes, man, they only entertainers
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Yeah, soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Jesus saved my soul)
And I cannot sell my soul


I've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
And I'm just a product of whatever I was raised in
This money sanctified, so I gotta say it again
They said I was mad at the Grammys
But I'm lookin' at my Grammy right now
Pulled up on Ye, and I said, ""They don't understand me""
I just want my dawg to pipe down
'Cause when you really came from the trenches
You was raised in the trenches (Mm)
You feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (Mm)
I hope God can forgive me for the days that I was sinnin' (Mhm)


The truth is only what you get away with, huh?

I said the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
Ayy, that's why a lot of these **** be fakin', huh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh, uh, well, well, here goes
Well, here goes, but here goes
I was one of them weirdos of the pure soul
That would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
Every color Girbauds, every Cutlass is cold
Every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gangbang
How we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom before Chief Keef was ""Bang, Bang""
Always had mob ties
Stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
And for all the guys that went to the White House and said, ""Free the old man""
Every day I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
I can give a dollar to every person on Earth
Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'
We gon' have to square up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then

Visiting Hours,Ed Sheeran,"I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you


Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right


Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away",69

I'm the same way, it's why we always argue back and forth
I swear she my poison, at the same time my antidote
She the noose around my neck, I couldn't ask for a better rope, ayy


You're like a time bomb ticking away
Thirty seconds 'til you blow up right in my face
I can't find one good reason to stay
So why do I hate when you're walking away?


You got me paralyzed
Go ahead, baby, take my life
'Cause I don't wanna live if I'm living without you
Suicide love, take me out if you have to
You got me paralyzed


She a dime, keep her in my pocket like some loose change
Drunk swervin' on the 101 back to your place
One wrong turn, fantasize 'bout the great escape
Hands off the wheel, close my eyes, let me meditate


You're like a time bomb ticking away
Thirty seconds 'til you blow up right in my face

So why do I hate when you're walking away?

You got me paralyzed
Go ahead, baby, take my life
'Cause I don't wanna live if I'm living without you
Suicide love, take me out if you have to
You got me paralyzed (I'm paralyzed)


You left your cocaine on my nightstand
Your favorite necklace is my right hand
Yet you were never a part of the plan
And it was over before it began


You got me paralyzed (I'm paralyzed)
Go ahead, baby, take my life (Just take my life)
'Cause I don't wanna live if I'm living without you

Brainwashed,Tom MacDonald,"Half the country fell asleep, but they scream ""woke""
We're distracted by vaccines and TV shows
Politics, celebrity gossip, popular neat quotes
Black lives, white lives, which lives mean most?
We only dedicate one day to remember our fallen soldiers
The men and women who died young
But if you come out the closet as Caitlyn Jenner
You're a hero and you get a whole pride month
The most dangÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµrous pandemic's propaganda from these clowns
Only mask that's gonna savÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ us is duct tape on they mouths
Don't speak, we don't need to defund police
Need to defund the media who lies through they teeth, like
Big pharma doesn't cure you, dawg
'Cause every patient that gets cured is a customer lost
And big oil runs the world, the only wars that get fought
Are with the countries who have natural resources they want
Heard 'em claiming if a white man braids his hair
And likes rap, he's appropriatin' culture
But if a white man acts too white, he's white trash
He's a racist, he's a bigot, he's a monster


Let's just have the conversation
Not every Liberal is dumb, not all Republicans are racist
The government wants everybody fighting with their neighbors
'Cause they know that if we get along, we'll probably go against 'em

They can't stop us
'Cause we're ready to fight
Try to brainwash us
But we won't let freedom die
The whole world's brainwashed
Everybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets
The whole world's brainwashed
It's us against them, it ain't you against me


How did monkeys become people and people turned into sheep?
They put fluoride in the water that's keeping us all asleep
Claim they want what's best for us, I find that hard to believe
'Cause they been selling us cigarettes since we was 18
Fake news, fake woke, distract, and divide
You're either right or you're left or you're black or you're white
Big tech don't need a microchip to hack in your life
'Cause the phone inside your pocket is a trackin' device
And I don't know what I'm more sick of
Rappers or Joe Biden, looking like he ate a hundred Xanax for dinner
'Cause censorin' the president and kicking him off Twitter
Is a bigger threat to freedom than foreign ballistic missiles
You don't trust the police or the government
But you want people giving up their right to own a firearm
Why would you be comfortable if police and the government
The only people on the planet with the right to buy a gun?
White privilege getting amplified to reinforce the vision
It convinces white people that they're favored by their skin
And black people getting angry 'cause they're told they're treated different
So the conflict is between us and never with the system

Let's just have the conversation
Not every Liberal is dumb, not all Republicans are racist
The government wants everybody fighting with their neighbors
'Cause they know that if we get along, we'll probably go against 'em


They can't stop us
'Cause we're ready to fight
Try to brainwash us
But we won't let freedom die
The whole world's brainwashed
Everybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets
The whole world's brainwashed
It's us against them, it ain't you against me


Step one, train the people only to consume
Step two, infiltrate adults with the news
Step three, indoctrinate the children through the schools
And the music and the apps on the phones that they use
Step four, separate the right from the left
Step five, separate the white from the black
Step six, separate the rich from the poor
Use religion and equality to separate 'em more
Step seven, fabricate a problem made of lies
Step eight, put it on the news every night
Step nine, when people start to fight and divide
Take control, this is called situational design

They can't stop us
'Cause we're ready to fight
Try to brainwash us
But we won't let freedom die
The whole world's brainwashed
Everybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets
The whole world's brainwashed
It's us against them, it ain't you against me",50

Niggas speak down on my name like I wasn't there for em
Talk about back in the days
This isn't back in the days
They want me back in my ways
Chipped tooth and the fade


Uh
Musically I'm on Mars
Walking all over the beat
Puttin my feet on the stars
I rock it like Lenny, thinkin like Jimi the first time he seen a guitar
Standin' in front of where they shot Ahmaud and we gotta know who we are


Uh
I'm in rare form
Wearin' rare Jordans straight from Air Jordan this a fair warning
Too many young gods beef over nothin
When you get money you know that it's comin
Sayin' they homies but they ain't a hunnid
We the most hunted uh
I got my Mets hat on to the back
Y'all already know where we going with the stats
Hall of Fame only Kings and Queens only
They all be grabbin' my style but you know they can't hold me


Yeah
I'm in rare form
Y'all still on the ground you know I been airborne
Studying BIG studying Nietzsche
You gotta call in a chopper to reach me
Homey I don't need a jeweler to freeze me
Ice in my veins I make it look easy


Mentally I'm in Queens
More money more problems you gotta be ready for all that it brings
Let em say what they say revenge on my plate I'm lovin' the taste
They see you shinin' emotions get hard to contain
They just not evolving the same
Me and HB is too rare
I'm movin' all thru the snares
Sound on billionaire
Ain't nothin' changed I'm flippin' the page
I'm Prince on the stage, slave on his face
You know what they say, KD the wave
I'm stayin' rare for all of my days


I'm stayin' rare for all of my days


Levels of Tarantino
Curbin' my ego, even though he know
Empty glass of Pinot, cigars and casinos
What they especially praise is the ethos
Stacks on blackjack, movin' my chips
No superstition to make me get rich
I'm with this chick just one I brought today
In between placing my bets we shopped at Cartier
Rose gold I copped her a set
Runway hopped in the jet
Flight attendant poppin' Moet
I said I need that Dom off of respect
We havin' conversations niggas show me property there
I called my nigga Ant and told him yo I gotta be there
Salmon shish kabob in a misty fog rollin' sticky log
Big dog affair no kids involved
Round table havin' war council
Press one button it'll change the world around you
Too rare, nuttin' to see here
Cuban over my streetwear
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you just to be fair
It's ok to keep the mystique I learned that in the street
On me, solo or deep, I'm puttin' on for the G's


We been doin' gangsta shit for a long time
Look inside my mind, see a gold mine
I'm my own co-sign
She textin' the old line
You keep staring at the glow bitch don't go blind
Braveheart energy, fuck all the enemies

I'm not here to be friendly they ain't even contending

Getting Older,Billie Eilish,"I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
Too bad they're usually deranged


Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged


Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much until we don't

I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm


Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of

That we care so much until we don't

Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)

You better lock your door (Oh)

We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)

Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left


I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone


Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I make at your people's house, outside shootin' that blick songs
And I'm still good on every block I used to knock P's on

Pulled out twenty somethin' just to let Johnny put my teeth on

Or give me a yacht parked out in the ocean

Give me a lawn chair under the stars

WASTING TIME (FEAT. DRAKE & THE NEPTUNES),Brent Faiyaz,,64
All I Know So Far,P!nk,"Haven't always been this way
I wasn't born a renegade
I felt alone, still feel afraid
I stumbled through it anyway


I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth


You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
That's all I know so far


So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage

I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
And even I can't teach you how to fly
But I can show you how to live like your life is on the line


You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far


That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far


I will be with you 'til the world blows up, yes
Up, and down, and through 'til the world blows up
Yeah
When it's right, or it's all fucked up 'til the world blows up
'Til the world blows up
And we will be enough and until the world blows up

Just throw your head back, and spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far


That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far


I will be with you 'til the world blows up, hm",68

And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture


So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)

On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes


Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons

The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah

I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

Before I knew what platinum was, was tryna go on hits
Well if he act like he 'bout it, then put him on the list
You better pick out a casket, 'cause they goin' quick
They gassed him up, now tears sheddin' when they post his pic
I know 'bout some flukey shit, I heard he died on a lick
My whole squad scorin', bitch, we don't do no assists
Potential wasted, couldn't stay in his lane, he ain't know his niche
Might catch him at the red light tryna load his blick

Always gotta spazz, unleash the beast when they recordin' me
Lord, I'm tryna take it easy on 'em, but they forcin' me

Pop shit like Taliban, loadin' up them sticks in a van
You know it's fuck the other side 'cause my niggas gone
Always been fuck the other side, we don't get along
If we bump heads, like Marvin Gaye, let's get it on
Aim for the head, that chopper spray, we get 'em gone

Tryna correct her flaw, she filled with silicone
And she ain't all innocent, she did a nigga wrong

We do some expensive stunting, uh
I got this drip from London, uh
You'd think he play in the post from the way that he come off the hip or something, uh
Empty a clip or somethin'
FN make him trip from runnin'
I'm speeding, my engine hummin'
We ain't totin' these blicks for nothin'
Come through and slam on a nigga like Drummond
I'm with the cappers, you know how we bomin'
Not from Atlanta, I'm talking 'bout losing your top, I done seen all them demons get summoned
Come from the bottom, so I gotta reach to the top, now I need sixty-five for a frontend
Now that Louis bag filled up with hundreds
I was so broke, man, that shit was disgusting


Like, boom
We make it hot like it's June
Turn his white tee to maroon
We put him up like a hot-air balloon
Now they claimin' he left too soon
Like move
Bitch, you ain't leaving with me, I don't know why that's what you assume
Like cool
Deep in that struggle for real, I ain't never had no silver spoon

Runnin' the city, might need me a statue or somethin'
Like watch out for Cap, 'cause he coming
We with the shits and a tool what I pack like I'm plumbin'
Send a hit just from tappin' a button
They wanna know why a young nigga flexing so hard
How he run up that sack all the sudden?

Man down, woah

Bloody Canvas,Polo G,"Head's burnin', wasn't told
To leave, the world is burning down
Never had no help from anyone (I'm Harry, Harry Potter)


Uh, let me tell you 'bout a young nigga, he was only fourteen
Don't fuck with niggas, he stay social distanced like he quarantined
Went from NBA to torn dreams
And a street legend in between
That's when prayers made him hit his knees
See, he was born Cabrini-era back in '99
On Chicago North Side, where the news reportin' live
He can't help but rep his hood, damn near born on his block
And his parents had him young, they ain't really have a lot
Seen his daddy gang bangin', one day, he might take his spot
Five years old and he taught him how to aim a Glock, uh
""Use that bitch to protect your family,"" that's what he told him
A empty clip, he grabbed the gun and practiced what he showed him
And his family hood famous, pop out, everybody know him
And his people stuck for him so he won't let nobody ho him
Uncle's tellin' street stories, shit intriguin' like a poem
Sayin' shit like he'd put it to they neck if anybody owe him
All through his childhood, he was bad, but innocent
Playin' basketball with his homies, runnin' scrimmages
This who he cracked jokes, made a bond, and got suspended with
And when they saw the opps, they fist-fought to settle differences
'Til one day, the opps, they got tired of gettin' beat up
They big homies gave 'em guns like, ""Man, go and light they street up""
They puttin' hoodies on, all black, loadin' heat up
Adrenaline pumpin', now, they can't wait until they see us
Normal day on the block, it was fun and all smiles
But his best friend Jacob wandered off from the crowd
Took a walk to the store, headphones bangin' loud
Then his opps bent the corner, he ain't see 'em come around
When he looked up at the car, that's when them shots went, ""Baow""
Blood oozin' with his back on the ground
Vision blurry, heartbeat slowin' down
Blood comin' out his mouth, feel like he startin' to drown
Tires screechin', last thing he heard was that sound
""Jacob just got shot,"" that's what a lady screamed
Now everybody out of breath, runnin' to the scene
Seein' Jacob on the floor, that was some shit they couldn't believe
His eyes rolling back, his auntie trying to tell him, ""Breathe""
Died 'fore the paramedics came, she cryin', ""Baby, please""
Ain't even get to graduate 'cause he was only seventeen
Shorty cried all night, wishin' that shit was just a dream
'Til that pain turned into anger, time to make a nigga bleed

Fuck, man
This nigga just took my best friend
And I, I can't go for that shit
It got me fucked up


And by the way, his name was Terrence, but they called him Sed
Dark skin, he wore a mean mug with some long dreads
Six-two, he good at hawkin' niggas down, he got long legs
Now he'll go and kill anybody that he want dead
They heard he caught his first body and that word spread
And he know how quick karma come around, but he wasn't scared
Sacrificed his soul in them streets like Illuminati
Now sellin' drugs and shootin' niggas, them his only hobbies
Big driller now, he the one to call and go and catch a homi'
Got the lo' on the nigga who killed his dawg, he want his second body
A lightskinned heavy-set nigga named Rodney
Say, ""He be out the west, off the Xans, movin' real sloppy""


Yo, what's the word?
Man, you won't believe who I found out the nigga who killed Jacob
It was the lil' nigga, Rodney
He be hangin' out up at the gas station on Pulaski, trying to make some money, nigga always out his mind
Oh, yeah?
Bet, say no more

Sed pulled up to the lo', lights off, it's like one o'clock
Grippin' on the silver Smith & Wesson with like thirty shots
He ain't gotta put one in the head, it's already cocked
Rodney got his back turned, he trying to sell his last rock
Sed hopped out the car, he ready to erase him
Rodney heard him comin', he gon' run before he let him fade him
It's like a demon in him 'cause his eyes red while he chase him
Rodney havin' some with regrets, now he just hopin' God save him
Shots to the leg, hollow tips ate him
Fell to the ground like his shoes, he ain't lace 'em
Sed walked up, stood over him like, ""Pussy, this for Jacob""
Gave him four shots to the stomach, then he faced him
Sed runnin' to his car, Rodney bleedin' on the pavement
He had untied his hoodie and they seen that on surveillance
Tryna match him to the footage, the police investigatin'
Plus they had his picture on the wall at the station
A week later, they had came and grabbed him from his mama house
Couldn't afford a lawyer in the county, fighting drama now
Said, ""Fuck it, takin' it to trial"", he ain't coppin' out
Judge gave him forty-nine years, now that's a lot to count


Now, prosecutors were asking for the judge to lock him up for up to twenty-five years
The judge gave him twenty-eight
Smith had the last word
Again, he was sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison
He has thirty days, Kelly, to appeal that sentence, back to you",58

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex


I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me",77

Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one


Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't

You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love

Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all
Surrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love

Ayy, I think my plug racist (Why is that?)
All he send is white (Let's go)
They going dumb in the slum where I'm from
Got a drum on a gun like a pair titties
They say that I'm makin' a major mistake for deliverin' weight but I barely listen
I got a play that I'm 'bout to go make for like 200K in a matter of minutes
I can remember the day when the shit was a shame and I didn't even have a penny
Brand new apartment and we couldn't afford no new furniture, put us a mattress in it
Went broke in the mall, I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it
My daughter turned one on a Sunday, next mornin' on Monday, I had to go back to prison
My woman was pregnant with Khaza, I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered
My sister was cryin', she want a new body
I went and got her some ass delivered
Grind independently, showin' no sympathy
Don't let the industry gas a nigga
Went bought me some diamonds, I did it for Mazi
But I never really been flashy with it
Kickin' myself in the ass, I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney

Shit, I give any man a chance ya heard me
But once you show me a flaw, that fall back game in full effect
Look, you can leave your gun in the car, dick

Was truly been given a taste, considered this taste for knowin' what foolish is
O.C. on the road when the coca was slow
But I still was on go, I was movin' pills
Money discussion, ain't asking a nigga for nothin'
You look like a fool, for real
Thumbin' through hunnids, attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin', I'm through with this
Caught me a head in a few attempts
Coppin' the gat with a coolin' kit
Depressin' as hell when you step on a scale
God damn, I got fat, I done grew some tits
Supposed to be a Muslim but they started judgin' me, laser removing the crucifix
I hit Rodeo I'm not on the payroll, I shot to Laredo to do it big
Shout out to players who movin' bricks
Breakin' the package down, boomin' knicks
I throw you a four-way, two for six
Stand on the jacket, I'm too legit
I stand in the kitchen and do the foo'
Weigh on the digi one, two to six, scrapin' the dish
She get her a push on a pipe and say Superman do exist
Movin' the wrist that's movie shit
Ain't moving like them, that's goofy shit
Caught me a blessin' 'cause I'm a perfectionist, shawty petite and her booty big
Tell 'em it's wonder this shit turnin' peoples into zombies and I don't approve of this
I got what you want, I deliver the fungus up under the trunk of the Honda Civic

I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs
And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there
They had their share of ups and downs
And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it

To get to that that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that


I've had some real close calls
A couple diamond ring thoughts
And enough midnight tears to know what love's not


I want that all in, fallin'
Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling
No matter what if I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that
Kinda heart open arms
Says forever and will never ever take it back
If I'm gonna love
I'm gonna love somebody like that


Somebody like that
Mmm, somebody like that
Love somebody like",72

If Pain Was A Person,Moneybagg Yo,"(Dee you poppin' your shit, nigga)
I been tryna figure out like
Why a motherfucker want you to be loyal to them?
And they ain't loyal to you, I don't, I don't really get that
Be tryna show love in private 'cause
They done told people they don't fuck with you in public and shit
That shit be crazy
I don't be understandin' that shit, niggas be feelin'
Slick way about bitches and
Come on man, if we ain't about no money, what we doin'? (Speak)


I done overplayed my part, they forgot about me, amnesia (It's cool though)
I done hit yours, you done hit mine, why you still mad? We even (I ain't on that)
The blogs put up anything (Shit made up), and the crazy part they believe 'em (For )
Nigga caught a charge and got locked up, only reason dude still breathin' (I swear)
I never make a hoe feel like I can't do no better than her (Who?)
Heard that she got a new nigga, my bag the biggest
She said he don't fuck how I fuck (Haha)
Bitch lied on God and her kids
Threw me off, damn, that fucked up my trust
I know a nigga'll cross you to win
Where you at with it? Yeah, I come from the bluff
Lil' bro don't go through there spinnin', can't do it myself (Why?)
'Cause my position
I'm peepin', niggas in slick competition
Really some bitches, sit down when they pissin'
They get some fame off me if I mention
But it's a shame on me if I did it
I know you obsessed with me and I get it
Stay in your lane and stay out my business (Over there)

Y'all running off with all these rumors and shit
Quick and shit, makin' assumptions
Next thing you know you judgin' a nigga, damn
What about the truth?
It's two sides to this shit
I've been that nigga
I've been lit, I've been the shit
Before I ever went public with a bitch
Y'all just catchin' on late
Speakin' on my personal life
My real life, talking 'bout how it's fake nigga
You ain't me, you ain't in my shoes
You ain't pay dues (Speak)


He ain't no gangsta, never did nothin' gangsta, that's what they said (That what they hollerin')
I done seen so many niggas end up dead 'cause they got misled (Facts)
Ain't got no time for no baby mouth ass nigga, tryna get spoon-fed (Nah)
All that he say she say, code red, numb to it, brain dead (Don't wanna hear it)
Without y'all, I wouldn't be shit
Hope the haters hear me loud and clear (I'm makin' sure)
Unc' told me, ""A scary man, a dead man, you can't live you life in fear""
So I'm takin' risks (Yeah)
You can't get a fair bond last time I checked
How them charges disappear? (Hol' up)
Lack of communication with my bitch (What?)
Got her actin' all insecure (Mane)
I come from the struggle like you did, nigga
Why the fuck you tryna down me? (Huh?)
If I gotta coach a nigga on how to be real, I don't need 'em around me (At all)
You can't fix your mouth to say I ain't fuck with you
At least one time, well, two times, nah, three times
Couldn't see the envy, I was too blind

See they probably thought I was runnin' out
Whole time I was holdin' back, shit an infinity clip
I'm what's goin' on, so I'm already knowin' my name gon' be in your mouth but
When you have them conversations
Make sure you mention he gettin' six figures for a show
Eleven whips paid for, house sittin' on four acres
Take care of his kids, treat all of 'em equally
Momma put up, she can wiggle her toes at night peacefully
Shit like that what I do it for, that's goals, nigga (Speak)


Hope for the best, prepare for the worse
However it come, just know that I'm ready (That's it)
You know a lie, don't give a fuck who tell it (Huh)
I know they mad but they never admit it (Who?)
It be your own people (Blood)
They gon' try to take advantage of you if you let 'em
They get a thrill off turnin' you down
But never gossip but how you help 'em
I heard it's niggas out hear wanna touch me
But I can't tell, I be where they at
Watch you draw the line, so stay over there
Don't come 'round the gang, don't throw up the set
You not what I rep
Why do some shit you gone regret? (Answer that)
Think smart with it, this shit chess (Ha)
Just 'cause y'all related, don't mean nothin'
Niggas Unc' ice about they check (I ain't Meech)
All that, ""You love me"", shit ain't genuine
And I felt the vibe when I walked in
Shit slick, hurt me thinkin' you solid then I saw you bend
Even after they true colors show, kept it real on my end
That wasn't my beef at first, I made it mine
'Cause me and bruh locked-in (For life and after)

When I say we la familia, we la familia, we locked in for life
Shit, loyalty over love
We gon' keep it real first
Like you not gon' see me fuckin' with my nigga opp
I don't give a fuck if I knew, his opp longer than him
Niggas'll hate you so much, they can know you'll opp a rat
And still hang with 'em
Don't that make them the same nigga?
Shit, let me know I need clarification
What part of the game is that?
See, I know what need to be done
Nigga need to start pullin', straight up checkin' these niggas
These niggas can't stand no pressure

There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark

But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here


Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone


So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good


I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂI thought it'd be me
Who helped him get homeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen
'Til you came along

So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good




So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good


So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good",80

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow


The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

So before you go

If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go


Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

If only I'da known you had a storm to weather

So before you go


Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight

Hid it in the bottom left drawer, right beside the sink
A shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band
Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand

I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)


No damsel in distress, don't need to save me

We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own


In chess, a king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high

I wish somebody would've gave me some damn signs
Yeah, I wish that night

Still Goin Down,Morgan Wallen,"The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin'ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂdown
InÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂa town whereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthe doors don't lock
And there's aÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmillion other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't


'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it clichÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country


Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume

'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it clichÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©, but hey, just take it from me

Skin,Sabrina Carpenter,"Maybe we could've been friends
If I met you in another life
Maybe then we could pretend
There's no gravity in the words we write
Maybe you didn't mean it
Maybe ""blonde"" was the only rhyme
The only rhyme

I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been tellin' your side

I just hope that one day
We both can laugh about it

Won't have to dance around it
Don't drive yourself insane
It won't always be this way

Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?


Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know


That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown


I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown


Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em


'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more",81

I wasn't worried about the other side when that shit was goin' on
And we don't hang with different niggas, don't ask us what we on
The only time we'll beat the case, you pull out camera phones
I used to draw Lil' Mo name on the styrofoam

Why the state had told the jury, ""They tryna indict us all""
The lawyers got them affidavits, they better sign them all, hm

Fake Woke,Tom MacDonald,"I think it's crazy I'm the one who they labeled as controversial
When Cardi B is the role model for 12-year-old girls
There's rappers pushin' Xanax at the top of the Billboard
But if I mention race in a song, I'm scared I'll get killed for it
It's backwards, it's gettin' exponentially dumb
It's more difficult to get a job than purchase a gun
Eminem used to gay bash and murder his mum
And now he doesn't want fans if they voted for Trump
We're ashamed to be American, you should probably love it
'Cause you have thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ right to say it and not get strung up in public
As children, we wÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµre taught how to walk and talk
But the system wants adults to sit down and shut up
Cancel culture runs the world now, the planet went crazy
Label everything we say as homophobic or racist
If you're white, then you're privileged, guilty by association
All our childhood heroes got Me-Too'd or they're rapists
They never freed the slaves, they realized that they don't need the chains
They gave us tiny screens, we think we free 'cause we can't see the cage
They knew that race war would be the game they'd need to play
For people to pick teams, they use the media to feed the flame


They so fake woke, facts don't care 'bout feelin's
They know they won't tell me what to believe in
They so fake woke, same old safe zones
They so fake woke, facts don't care 'bout your feelin's

I think it's crazy all these people screamin' facts, but they fake woke
Hate their neighbor 'cause he wears a mask or he stays home
Has a daughter, but his favorite artist said he slays hoes
Picks her up from school, music slaps on the way home
Censorship's an issue 'cause they choose what they erase
There's a difference between hate speech and speech that you hate
I think Black Lives Matter was the stupidest name
When the system's screwin' everyone exactly the same
I just wanna spend Thanksgivin' Day with food and my family
Without bein' accused of celebrating native casualties
We got so divided, it's black and white and political
Republicans are bigots, libtards if you're liberal
There's riots in our streets, and it's just gettin' worse
Y'all screamin', ""Defund the police"", y'all are genius for sure
They're underfunded already, they're way too busy to work
Order food and call the cops, see what reaches you first
Segregation ended, that's a lie in itself
That was a strategy to make us think they were tryin' to help
They knew that racism was hot, if they designed it to sell
We'd buy up every single box and divide us ourselves


They so fake woke, facts don't care 'bout feelin's
They know they won't tell me what to believe in
They so fake woke, same old safe zones
They so fake woke, facts don't care 'bout your feelin's

We use violence to get peace and wonder why it isn't workin'
That's like sleepin' with a football team to try and be a virgin
Politicians are for sale and someone always makes the purchase
But you and I cannot afford it, our democracy is worthless
If a man has mental illness, call him crazy, say it silently
When country's goin' crazy, we accept it as society
Get sick and take a pill, when the side effects get you high
You get addicted like these rappers dying fighting with sobriety
Censoring the facts turns our children into idiots
They claim it's for our safety, I'll tell you what it really is
Removing information that empowers all the citizens
The truth doesn't damage points of view that are legitimate
They're tryna change amen to a-men-and-women
How'd we let them make praying a microaggression?
Instead of asking God for the strength to keep winnin'
We cheat to get ahead and then we ask Him for forgiveness
Feminism used to be the most righteous of fights
But these days it feels like they secretly hate guys
I don't trust anyone who bleeds for a week and don't die
I'm just kiddin', but everything else that I said is right


They so fake woke, facts don't care 'bout feelin's
They know they won't tell me what to believe in
They so fake woke, same old safe zones
They so fake woke, facts don't care 'bout your feelin's",62

Neon Eyes,Morgan Wallen,"They started out blue like an East Tennessee June sky
Full of small-town innocence
Guarded by a picket fence
Perfect 'til I drove by
You were lookin' for a way out and I was on my way
Girl, once you love a cowboy, you'll never be the same
I know right now you think this is it
But I'm gonna leave you with


Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ dance floor
Never rÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµally gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes


Right now, they're glowin' like the cigarette we just sparked
Aw, but I've seen this scene before
Like the lights on a liquor store
Pretty soon, they'll go dark
I know you're tired of all the same shit
That's why you think you want this
I can show you first-hand, girl, what you wish you'da missed
But if you won't take it from me
I guess you're gonna have to see through

Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes
Neon eyes


I don't wanna be the one to say I told you so
Just let me push you away before you get too close
I can't go and make up your mind
And I don't wanna be the reason behind those


Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes

More Surprised Than Me,Morgan Wallen,"I bought a Harvard sweatshirt off the Goodwill rack
Makes some people wonder if I'm smart like that
And that guitar layin' on the chair is worn out like my boots
Makes it look like I can play it better than I do


But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me


It's funny how some strangers like to size me up
This attitude it makes me street and this accent makes me dumb
I can tell 'em I've got pirate blood or ancient royalty
ThÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµre's no end to the liÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµs that I could get 'em to believe


But nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me



Must've done somethin' right
Somethin' right
In another life


'Cause nobody buys it when we walk in
They say there ain't no way that she could be with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me

Spin around dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer

Saw her in the corner sippin' something tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit off
Get down the road I'm watching her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurts so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chased my pride with another round

Burning smokes and wondering
If there's anything I've done right
Well, I wish that I could go back
Hang on to what I had

Nothin' but a dream

Funny how seeing you once after a few months
Gets you locked out
Right back to telling folks you know I know
All about some new guy taking you out
Then you unfollow me then follow me back
Just so I know you're still around


Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do


Some hearts stay broke, some hearts don't skip a beat
Some people say goodbye then try to make it alright
Just like you're doing to me, but tonight I'm letting it ring

Someone hopped out, a big goofy nigga, he tryna look tough
I'm like, ""What? What he tryna do?"" So I clutched my move

Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip
Now I'm like, ""Shit,"" I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick
And I don't miss, I let off two shots, I hit him in his shit
Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, ""Get in,"" 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, ""No doubt""
""I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb""
She started laughin', she say, ""Fuck that nigga, he from 63rd""

If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill

Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (Shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards, these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask)
'Nother fourteen-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything

My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia

When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (Dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause

Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year


Stockings on chimneys, angels on trees
Sugar and cinnamon, it's the little things
Blankets and movies in black and white
Together they make up this colorful life

'Tis the season we've been waiting for
(Waiting, don't keep me waiting)
Oh, can't you feel it knocking at your door?
(Knock, knock, it's knocking at your door)


Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time
Pretty little wishes tied up in a bow
And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year


Christmas is my favorite time
Christmas is my favorite time
Christmas is my favorite time
Oh, don't keep me waiting


Love pouring out like the snow from the sky
Snuggled up together sitting by the fire
Oh, it's magical, it's my favorite time

And every little kiss is like we're underneath the mistletoe
It's music to my ears
Christmas is my favorite time of year

Christmas is my favorite time of year

The First Noel,Gabby Barrett,"The First Noel, the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep


Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!


They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night


Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!


Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That have made heaven and earth of naught
And with His blood mankind hath bought

Born is the King of Israel!

If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
They be Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend


He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club
Got you dancing in the middle of the club
I know what you chasing, you can only get this feeling from a thug
You can only get this feeling from a thug
Tears falling, and it's liquor in your cup, all you really want is love
Baby, all you really want is love
Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub
Girl, I know you can't be fucking with a scrub (Kdubb)

I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it


He was playing games, got you dancing in the middle of the club

But I watch your eyes as she


Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die


Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
(Wish I were Heather)


Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she


Walks by

I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying

Turn around, poke it out, bitch, get it, get it (Get it, get it)
Turn up on 'em, make 'em kill the noise
We ain't goin' back and forth with the lil' boys


Why you wanna do the bad bitch wrong?
'Bout to make this every bad bitch song, ayy
Don't you hate when you hold a nigga down
Then he switch up on you, turn out to be a clown? Ayy
Look, I ain't in my feelings with it
Turn around, poke it out, bitch, get it, get it
Turn up on 'em, make 'em kill the noise

We ain't goin' back and forth with the lil' boys",55

When you're talkin' like that, girl?""
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I turned back
Before you came along
I could go all alone
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want

When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want

One of the realest shit I ever (Torey, I know what to do with this)
Shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, you know how I'm kickin' it


Rockstar chain all the way to the floor, dawg
Ain't tryna be cool with no rap nigga, I'm fuckin' they ho, dawg
Took two Addys, then counted an M and damn near dozed off
I'm in the stars drivin' myself, I feel like autopilot
Designer Goyard bucket, I'm my own stylist
I done made it out the streets, my brothers still wildin'
Had to go Draco, Draco, Draco, all I could do about it
Soon as it come my way, I can't do nothin' but see about it


I'ma get me a B up out it, started with a milli'
Made it out the trenches, I can't ever plead guilty
Crushed her heart when she found out I crushed her friend
Played it smart 'cause either way, I gotta win
I wear my heart on my sleeve, they ain't real as me
We could've kept it way more cordial, but it's chemistry
You kept me over through the night and boost my energy
I'm thankin' you, I'm thankin' me for curiosity
Coolest thing to do is to be cool with a nigga and fuckin' on his bitch
I know niggas'd do it to me so I'm always gon' send that hit
She said she true and she said she loyal, that's how they come to me
I know what really turn you on and I'ma keep our secret

Had to go Draco, Draco, Draco, all I could do about it
Soon as it come my way, I can't do nothin' but see about it


Started with a million dollars, go 'head and get me billi'
I'm from the trenches, so the clip least hold a fifty
Crushed ice, Cartier frames, or Chrome Hearts
Niggas ain't solid as they claim, so I play it smart
I'm changin' weather, I'm thinkin' better, I'm peepin' the energy
I left my heart in the streets, so ain't no sympathy
If you ain't with me, you against me, you the enemy
Playin' my cards, sittin' in the stars, this the life I lead
Coolest thing you could do is squash the beef and still send a hit
I know niggas'd do it to me, so I ain't gon' never stop a blitz
She say it's loyalty, no betrayal when it come to me
I know what really turn you on and I'ma keep a secret

Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in

Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots


But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you


I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth

But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey

Thriller,Michael Jackson,"It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed


'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh


You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight


Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh


They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller, here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow)


I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'allÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away",89

The Other Guy,Luke Combs,"She said, I never thought I'd see you here
Hangin' on this side of town
What's it been, about a year?
Yeah, boy, look at you now
I heard you got a new job
Things are takin' off
Just like I thought they would
I said it's all good


But you should see the other guy that's missin' you
Late at night, he's wishin' you would come back home
Girl, he can't move on
And his heart still takes a beatin'
Just livin' with your leavin'
Yeah, it might look like I'm doin' alright
But you should see the other guy


As far as anyone can see
Things are lookin' up these days
Only let 'em see this side of me
The one that's got it made
Doin' everything I know to do
To keep thÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµ truth
From runnin' through my mind
Yeah, I'm doin' fine

But you should see the othÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂµr guy that's missin' you
Late at night, he's wishin' you would come back home

Last night, people protesting in MinneapolisÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂescalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)


Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear


Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear


They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here

He was just gettin' into his best years
Yeah, somethin' like that'll shake you up
Wake you up


So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama


It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all
I got to really thinking this morning
About what's important


So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

And from now on
I ain't gonna wait so long


To stop off at a Texaco, buy a Slim Jim and a coke
Park out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grab my guitar from the back seat, write a song just for me
Sing it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I think of home, grab my phone from my pocket

But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?


No love letters, no X and O's
No love, never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone
Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

Chasin' You,Morgan Wallen,"We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then


Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you


You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you


Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town

Die From A Broken Heart,Maddie & Tae,"Hey mama, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillowcase?
Cure a one-too-many headache?
Mama, can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?


How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?


Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Mama, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart


Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? (Prayin' so hard)
Can you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark)
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?


How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?

Money Over Fallouts,Tory Lanez,"It's one of the crazier stories weÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂve heard of, guys (I know)
As it's unfolding it's likeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂFuck Tory Lanez, okay? Now, IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm from Houston, and he's from, bro
And to think that the whole night unfolded on social media
You are the alleged shooter of Megan Thee Stallion
Instagram, in the pool with Kylie Jenner
Was she backtracking with what she said originally?
You know, maybe that's why we don't have a report
Donkey of the day
Some bitches tryna  take up for Tory and, ""It's more to the story,"" bitch, it ain't-there ain't nothing to the story
Tory Lanez got a lot of bad press
Serious, he's gonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ get deported
Donkey of the day for Friday August 21st goes to Daystar Peterson
So they got pulled over and she had been shot already, great
Well, hold upÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Donkey of the Day
What IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm looking like, he looking at the police and then shot her?
Niggas like that, you a sucker, he's the king sucker, heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs the-he's the biggest sucker in the industry (Facts)
We gotta talk about Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion
Kaash is looking for you, dawg
Because the police came out saying, ""We didn't even know she was shot""
Guess who I believe? Megan
The best thing for Tory Lanez is for real, he needs to just begone

I'm done with this, you gotta know the truth

Ayy, they rather see me in the cell
Like how he posted out with thirty thousand dollar bail?
IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm the GOAT, y'all niggas know I made that dope float on the scale
I had them hoes goin' crazy, fiends crackin', goin' pale
They know I'm real, I got that flow, it's on sale if you need a rush
Coke blowin' out my fiend's nose like the speaker bus
Ho caught me D'd up, talk down, we T'ing up
Megan people tryna frame me for a shootin'
But them boys ain't clean enough
I see how they teamin' up, watchin' and I'm calculatin'
Gotta keep it quiet, I can't jeopardize the outcome waitin'
Seein' certain niggas hatin', like, how this nigga hatin'?
I done gave these people so much features, made these niggas famous
They was on the blog sayin' I'm canceled from this entertainment
I was on that Spotify like thirty million monthly listeners, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
And my fans support me brazy, everythin' I do is for you, I promise I'll be on it daily
I got nothin' but love to spread, but niggas hate me
Hurt my heart to see them Twitter fingers come from Kehlani's and Kaash Paige's
But I flipped the switch, I'm grippin' money at that fast pace
And don't ask me for shit when it get real, that's my last favor
Can't cry now 'cause I'ma laugh later
Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit
Knowin' I ain't do it but I'm comin' at my truest
Tryna keep this shit two hunnid with you, shorty, I can prove it
But them people in yo ear, they the true ones that I fear
They really got you thinkin' Tory Lanez would do you in, for real
Don't forget you was my bitch, I held it down and kept it real
I would never paint no fake picture of you just for some mills
And I thought that you was solid too, but look at how you doin' me
Look at how you doin' me, people tryna ruin me
And what's even worse is I'm still thinkin' about you and me
How you goin' live my birthday with all your jewelry to try to make some fool of me?
But I love you hard so I'm gon' cool it, B
'Cause I was coolin' right with Cuban, B, that was a stupid me
Somehow I'm still down to renegotiate the unity
My heart in some foolery, this shit is just confusin' me
I'm goin' through these phases, but I gotta stack that paper
And the real estate niggas hatin', took me off that application
But when they took that from me, they really took that from my baby
What the fuck I'm finna say to his old lady?
What the fuck y'all mean, my son don't need a house?
My baby momma don't need safety?
And even though I got the payment, the real estate niggas still hatin'
'Cause he watchin' me all on the news, but I ain't charged with no cases
Say the owner say my case is lookin' crazy, how the fuck that even make sense?
New times turn to past tense
All I want is straight cash, niggas say I lack sense
Star player, hearin' lies comin' from the back bench
Kill or be killed, that's the reason I don't have friends
Niggas lyin' on the crodie, niggas sayin' I'm deported
Oh, now I'm 5'3""? Niggas sayin' I'm a shorty
But lil' bitch I'm 5'7"", money on me side-steppin'
And if I stand on my wallet, you can see my thighs in Heaven
One Umbrella gang and when we come back, don't you try reppin'
'Fore I let these niggas breathe, I gotta teach a couple lessons
Gotta see a couple questions: how the fuck you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons?
How the fuck your team is tryna to paint me as some whole menace?
I just lost like ten million dollars because this cold business
But I got like ten million followers that's gon' roll with me
Fans that support me 'cause they know my heart
So I don't give a damn if shorty know Jigga
I was taught to beat the block
Eeny, meeny, miney in these streets, and so my Nina cocked
Niggas, y'all can play me, y'all can frame me, but I'ma reach the top
I would never put you in no danger, and if I did, you would've said it when you seen the cops

Ayy, Lamborghini bands and they comin' out the floor
Fff, hit the fan when I'm pullin' out the dough-oh
I would never fall out with niggas over hoes, ayy
Money over fall outs, my nigga, that's the code-oh
Santorini bands when I pull up to the coast
Better have my bands when I pull up to the door-oh
Niggas can't believe I done pulled up in a Ghost
And I don't ever wanna fuck with y'all no more, G


I got bad bitches tryna have a orgy
Keep umbrellas for the days it get stormy
I pour the Henny for my niggas, that's before me
My outfit fly, you gotta seat out by the floor seats
She tatted me all on her face 'cause she adore me
They talkin' petty 'bout me but they lookin' corny
I had to fight for mine, nigga, you were sworn in
And God bless me when I wake up every mornin'",44

Tell my girl these hoes can't make me cum, I only want her to do it
Ten lines straight, goin' on ten days, my body ain't got no fluid

I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done
Like a faded out song on the radio, done
Like the cowboy gets the girl when the credits roll
I'd give you a lifetime of days in the sun
Whatever you need and you want
I won't stop 'til it's done


Done
All the hell I was raising, done
All the careless heart-breaking, done
For the chance that you're taking
I spend my nights praying and all my days chasing

That house on the hill with the 4-plank around it
Every last breath 'til the last star is counted
Just say the word, girl
Paint me your perfect
I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done
Like a faded out song on the radio, done
Like the cowboy gets the girl when the credits roll
I'd give you a lifetime of days in the sun
Whatever you need and you want
I won't stop 'til it's done


You know I won't stop 'til it's done
You need a man you can lean on, done
You need some faith you can hang your dreams on
Check 'em off one by one


And that house on the hill with the 4-plank around it
Every last breath 'til the last star is counted
Just say the word, girl
Paint me your perfect
I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done

I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me

I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming

Ayy
I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call


It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to


You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet


Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?
It's almost like you don't want me to

I wrote this song for you, so you should pay attention
I was just staring at the ceiling and got in my feelings
Reminiscing about us fighting, fucking, and chilling
Right now, I'm riding through Memphis, passing through the city
I'm with my niggas, but I miss you, girl, don't get it twisted
And I cannot wait 'til I see you, hug you, and kiss you
Remember when I had first met you how I used to sweat you
I used to call your phone and text you and tell you you're special
Like girl, you're special, you the kinda girl that I need
I actually made you mine, sometimes, I can't believe
Wonder what your nigga was thinking when he let you leave
You try to leave, I might get down on my hands and knees
I'm still a G, please believe, but girl, you make me weak
You make me feel something I never felt, the reason I never left
A lot of hoes want your position, but they tripping
You been with me since the beginning and that's the way I'ma end it

But just in case you feel you cannot stay, babe
Cars, clothes, and hoes, I'd trade it all
For a guaranteed spot in your heart
Wonder do you miss me when I'm busy on the road?
Wonder do you hear me? I'm in Houston all alone

One Big Country Song,LOCASH,"Yeah, life is like a jukebox, just push play
Not everybody's first word sounds the same
But we all get born and we all get raised

Everybody turns wild when you're sixteen
Slow roll, big timin' on Main Street
Everybody's got holes in their blue jeans
If you bought 'em that way or not


Turn it up and sing along
We all work 'til the daylight's gone
We all knock off the edge around five
Fall in love from a kiss on Friday night
And we've all had a broken heart
We've all closed down a few good bars
Take a look around, y'all, tell me I'm wrong
Ain't the whole wide world just one big country song?


Just one big country song


Yeah, well who don't try to find some water when it's hot? (When it's hot)
Whether it's a pontoon, tube, or a yacht (Yeah)
And who ain't got a dog that they love like a brother? (I do)
And who ain't ever tasted better cookin' than their mother?
And who ain't got a story to tell?
And who ain't made it through some hell?
Who don't love somebody, don't miss somebody?
If you're down, sing it with somebody

Turn it up and sing along
We all work 'til the daylight's gone
We all knock off the edge around five
Fall in love from a kiss on Friday night

Tried to tell my mama she don't gotta work no job
But she the one who taught her baby boy to hustle hard

Say it's some shit from way back in the day that left her scarred

I just did the dash in a Maserati engine
Been all around the world, I met all kind of women
Took me to have my own kid to see it different
Shout out to all my niggas trappin' livin' tax-free
These days, it's seven figures when they tax me
I can't complain, I came straight off the back streets
Can't explain how I feel, I'm just happy I'm here

Sip from the bottle for shit that we bottlin' in
Goin' live, but we not on the 'Gram
This the land of supply and demand
Where my young niggas choppin' up grams
And them choppers won't pry from they hands
Packin' lead like they got a exam
If it's beef, my niggas look just like homewreckers
They got they eye on your mans
I pray to God that it jam
Too many done died in these parts
So we gotta be smart if we tryna see August
Some niggas won't make it past summer regardless
I'm tryin' my hardest to stack my deposits
These niggas be lookin' at me like I got it
Deep down inside, though, I still feel as broke
As that nigga who just graduated from college
Scrapin' up change that got left in my pockets
I'm tryna make nickels turn into a dollar
Ridin' the train, way too shy to go holler
Just watched her get off at her stop, I'm a coward
Fuck it, though, you got a way bigger target
I'ma do it so big, they won't know what to call it
Sound like a whole Lambo' truck in my stomach
Bitch, I ain't hungry, this feeling is starving
Gotta move mama from out them apartments
Gotta put 'Ville on the map, we forgotten
Gotta hit hoes you hang up in your locker
Gotta get rich, 'cause my granny picked cotton
Gotta make hits, 'cause if not, then I'm floppin'
Gotta stay me in the process
Niggas dissed me, it was nonsense
I sat 'em down like his father
My nigga asked, ""Why you bother?
We should've caught him and mobbed him""
I said, ""We gotta move smarter""
Don't wan' be the reason for one more sad song
I tried to warn niggas they wouldn't last long
I hope that you see how they came and they went
They shots never hit, but they made they attempts
May have a good year like that name on the blimp
But you know what it takes to be poppin' this long?
Dedication on another level niggas never seen in they life
Celebratin' all your first downs like they touchdowns bring a price
Young Simba had the bustdown, yeah, the Lion King on ice
Niggas wanted me to look the part, had to stop takin' advice
Put the jewelry to the side, had to find me, had to find God
Half the time, we be pacifyin', what they expect from us?
But that's treacherous, that shows less of us
I need y'all to see every part of me
Every scar and every artery
Every story that I can recall, then I can fall

I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie
I got blood on my hands, I ain't gon' lie
I got mud on my shoes, I ain't gon' lie
I got real, real big plans, I ain't gon' lie
Got a whole lot to prove, I ain't gon' lie (Uh)


Lately, I reflect on the times a nigga was low
I got it up off the floor, I'm stronger than ever before
I'm stronger than ever before just like I planned to be
They wanna see me fold, it ain't no thang to me
Thoughts when I was broke, if only I could be
Pockets holdin' hope, it ain't no thang to me
At night, I hit my knees, I prayed for better days
Then found a better me, I got my head on straight


Up, up, and away, just ridin' my wave, I ain't never gon' say nothin'
Nigga throw a shot my way, I just jot down names, ain't never gon' say nothin'
Know you be stressin', hate only block your blessin', I'm never gon' say nothin'
Quit all that flexin', niggas live check to check, I'm never gon' say nothin'
Know that it's destined",59

After A Few,Travis Denning,"I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking


A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent


But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few


We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time


After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few


Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends


After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few",61

In Between,Scotty McCreery,"I'm a little bit a ball cap
Little bit a pearl snap button down shirt
Little bit a big city concrete
But a lot more small town dirt


I can see your pretty eyes
Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am
And where I'm at


I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between

I can be a steel toe work boot
40 hour blue collar, mud on my jeans
Then on weekend pack a bag
Disappear kick back on a white sand beach


I'm a far cry from being
A one night stand
But I ain't ready
For a ring on my hand


I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam

IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂscrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂstartedÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtoÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂread
She mad atÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthese crackers, sheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead, when you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveyin' you holier, come help us get up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet,"" most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable, but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore, we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like, ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on tha Bluff?
Well, maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doin' enough

The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today


Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on, cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryin' to let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes
Fill me up with wisdom and some courage
Plus endurance to survive, help mine thrive",66

To shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room, I couldn't help but notice you
Seem a little down on your luck too
Yeah, my heart might be breakin', but this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'


We should be drinkin' alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems, we ain't gonna solve 'em

When you change the whole world with your heart

City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd

Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me

Someone You Loved,Lewis Capaldi,"I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain


Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved


I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape


Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around


For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

It's soÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhard to payÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂattention to the signs
Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
Broken hearts can make a grown man cry


I was sittin' there just thinkin', then reality, it hit me
Hope I feel your same pain when that bitch Karma come and get me
Feel like I don't deserve you no more, but I want you to be with me
We done built a bond so strong, and from that love, I know you miss me
Connected to your soul, I feel it when you hug and kiss me
Now your shoulder is so cold and lately, I been feelin' empty
I got caught up in this fame and all these hoes, I let it tempt me
In that hotel room alone, remember I would hold you gently
Went on dates, we took some pictures, everything was movin' quickly
Manipulated, I ain't think a new relationship would fit me
But I told you we can try it, even though I know it's risky
Mind games with our emotions, swear this shit get kinda tricky

Girl, you got me losin' my mind
I just want you to see that I'm trying
Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
Don't want to lose you in this race against time
Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
Broken hearts can make a grown man cry


Keep her in Love PINK 'cause I like how them joggers fit her
Wonderin' how I'ma play it, it was hard to get her
So beautiful, I keep her smilin' when I compliment her
If bein' this bad is a sin, I hope that God forgive her
Just had a son, I'm tryna be the perfect father figure
I kept you worried, in them trenches tryna dodge the killers
Tryna escape from this commitment made our problems bigger
It's hard to love with dysfunction, wish my scars was thinner
Tryna forgive me in your thoughts, I hope your heart remember
Know it's gon' hurt to see another nigga bondin' with her
Can't even look you in your eyes 'cause I'm burnin' up with guilt
For that one moment, went too far, and now I fucked up what we built


Girl, you got me losin' my mind
I just want you to see that I'm trying
Ever since you left, the sun don't shine
Don't want to lose you in this race against time
Hypnotized by your love, I'm blind
It's so hard to pay attention to the signs
Without you, feel like slowly, I'm dying
Broken hearts can make a grown man cry",66

Bitch, I'm from Chiraq, when it get hot, they bring them TECs out
Better watch your back or you'll be on that corner stretched out
Quick to change a nigga standin' tall with his chest out
And they like headshots, it won't make sense to bring a vest out
Shit be devastatin', you find out your homie checked out
Parents lose control, don't know her daughter havin' sex now
Niggas hatin', I'm gettin' paper, that's what they pressed 'bout
Went down the wrong path, switched it up and chose the best route
I ain't used to have it all, I used to feel left out
'Member I was broke, ain't have a dollar, I was stressed out
Now I'm tryna get richer, like Blast, let's bring the jets out

Got a baby 40 with a new extended clip inside
For any problem, bitch, it's twenty-two up in this clip of mine
My peoples lookin' up to me, so no, I can't be victimized
I got so much pent-up anger, I just wish a nigga tried
You gon' die before you blink, yeah, that's gon' be a quick demise
The world be so fucked up, that shit'll have you sick and tired
You can't even post a picture without being criticized
Was broke, but now I'm living everything I used to visualize
Thinking 'bout them stories, still don't make sense how my niggas died
That shit still haunt me to this day, them L's hurt a nigga pride
How both of the twins leave? Why one of them didn't survive?
Still want that point for Gucci, look his killer in his eyes
My bad I never scored for y'all, but at least a nigga tried
Walking through the opp shit with my Wesson, I couldn't get a ride
I gotta run through a check for every tear a nigga cried

I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?
Left us behind, you seen that light glare
I know you walkin' up to Heaven on them white stairs
Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care


Let's just be friends before we rush into a label
Wanna know if you really fuck with me, girl, what's your angle?
It's only for the better if I'm tryna change you
Lovin' me ain't easy, if you leave, I don't blame you
Trauma got me fucked up, so I'm mentally unstable
I got wrapped up in my emotions, now I'm tangled
Deep in my thoughts and overthinkin' can get painful
Watch how I move, one wrong decision can be fatal
Hidden messages, conversations with my angels
Just walk with me and you'll see I'm tryna save you
Most times I'm by myself, I'm still confused from betrayal
From rags to riches, shit still hard, I'm just on phase two

Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share

I know life is a bitch and she don't fight fair
How the fuck I wake up from a dream to a nightmare?

Why I can't just pull up to your crib and see you right there?
Nobody love you 'til you dead, that's when they might care


Livin' on his own and he runnin' out of options now
'Cause he felt like he couldn't be hisself at his mama house
Hittin' licks, missin' school, junior year, he thought 'bout droppin' out
Him against the world, 40 on him when he poppin' out
On his dark road, he just tryna find a proper route
Hate the criticism, he uses music to block it out
By his auntie, he was molested as a baby boy
Messed up his head, it even changed the way he play with toys
Up late night rappin' and they told him to quit makin' noise
Stuck in his feelings, he be spendin' every day annoyed
He wanna stand over a nigga, leave his face destroyed
He miss his hood, now this something that he can't avoid


Bondin' over drugs and pain, dirty Sprite share

Walk you 'round the foothills of my town

After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now


We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road


If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine


My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and

Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands

Yeah, I seen my chance and that's when I grabbed it
Fuck bein' a hundred, I spent a couple hundred on niggas' tablets
Lean gave me chest pain, that's when I popped the Perky tablet
I tried to get that family vibe for niggas who wasn't established
You do that shit again, what you did to bro gon' get you a casket
I did shit for niggas without them askin'
I broke pounds for niggas without them matchin'
I don't fuck with you, I'ma tell y'all nah even though I got it

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


This shit was different, we was together like ten years ago
And I don't talk to a lotta niggas, but they still the bros
The ones I ain't talk to like that back then, know they still hoes
And some niggas try to hide they hate, but that shit still show
I never fucked on block hoes because I call 'em sisters
One hate me right now as I speak because I called her a hooker
Cut the loose ends, I cut 'em off, they try to say I'm a butcher
Bitch, you a rat, never mind, I changed my life, I'm Muslim
I talked to Chops on FaceTime, he say, ""Damn, you back smokin'""
He say, ""That back door damn near closed,"" I say, ""It's back open""
I say, ""These blocks could be back one,"" he say, ""You back hopin'""
You gotta watch them niggas you love 'cause they still backdoorin'
He ain't got no hope in beatin' his trial because he lost his motion
Bro got life, he don't know how pussy smell, that's why he fuck his lotion
I know some real niggas would lose it all for a viral moment
My dreads swing, I feel like Wayne, show me my opponent


You know, I like talkin' to the streets, like
When you say you the voice, you gotta, like, open up, like
Tell motherfuckers, like, what it is, like, you can't hold nothin' back
You gotta relate to them, relate to the poverty, you know what I'm sayin'?
Relate to the trenches
You know what I'm sayin', I can't be talkin' 'bout a Richard Mille all the time, know what I'm sayin'?
Some of the guys don't even know what the fuck a Richard Mille is
Know what I'm sayin'? You gotta relate
All angles, know what I'm sayin'?

Slow Dance In A Parking Lot,Jordan Davis,"Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just


Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)


A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to ""She's Every Woman""
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot


And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just


A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking",73

Deep Pockets,Drake,"For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look


Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' onÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcrushedÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂleaves
They turn theyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂback on everything we built, thenÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthey must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'

Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'


Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention

Then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'",58
When To Say When,Drake,"Yeah
Somebody, um
Somebody hit me today and they were like
""Nah, just make sure, you know
You tellÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhat to doÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhen I get there, you know?""
(June,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂyou're a genius)
I said, ""I respect it, no problem""
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real


Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, ""Damn, coach, put him in""
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when
Yeah

For real
Facts, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hahaha, yeah",61

Anybody feelÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂany way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)


Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You sold me up the river, but I rowed back
You put me on the road without a roadmap
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

You got some liquor at the house?
Yeah
Go get a shot, let's do a shot together
I don't see it
Okay, hahaha


Ayy
Being here wasn't in the plans
I do it for the Grahams, not the 'Gram
I do it for the fam, but still fuckin' Uncle Sam
I tried to change for you, but that wasn't who I am
Even when being real is out of fashion
Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why
It was always you and I without the T-Y
This is not one of them stories that got three sides
This is not one of them stories you could rewind
Like I'm tryna show the waves, this is no cap
You drove a nigga crazy, but I drove back
You wrote me off and then you never wrote back
I'm not tryna make no song, these are cold facts

Yes, sir
(Baby)
Hold on, hold on
(Let me tell you something about me)
(I really do know, I know who I wanna be)
Woo
Lord, I already passed on all that (Woo)

I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

Make sure my phone on DND, I keep my door closed
I been tryna put the rap game in a chokehold

We got weed, pills, and lean by the boatload
Don't stop at red lights, we stuck in go mode
They killin' kids, wonder why the summer so cold
When your face pop up in my head, all I can say is, ""Damn""
Don't try to test us in here like we don't ace exams
For one night, she gon' turn up to this song like it's her favorite jam
And I'll slide in that X7 'fore I take the Lam'
Critiquing all my movements, type of shit that make me hate the 'Gram
Know I'm not perfect, just accept me for the way I am

Had to make some plays up in that field, bitch, we got tired of fumblin'
Hidin' them lil' shorties who stepped up like who gon' slide or somethin'?
My niggas won't play, they hawk shit down 'til you get tired of runnin'
He tripped and fell, they stood over him and that nine was dumpin'
Like taco night, we leave them shells sittin' inside your stomach
Story the same, you know the usual, we die for nothin'
I dressed up for too many funerals, I'm tired of comin'
Made it out that shit, but it left scars, I'm still survivin' from it
All them bad thoughts just tore me down, feel like my mind was crumblin'
I just want all this shit figured out, I swear I'm tired of wonderin'
Just 'cause y'all rep the same thang don't mean them guys a hundred
I come from starvin', fightin' cases, now I'm flyin' to London

You got a long road, boy, a cold one
Straight up
Only love what you do for 'em
The only kinda love out here, my nigga


Who can you trust in this cold, cold world? Better get a blanket
It's worse than the wild, wild west, this shit get dangerous
Never thought I'd see the day separate glitter from gold
When friends turn into foes, but it's the life that I chose
And these hoes look so heaven-sent, but be so devilish
Got spiteful ways, never seen it coming like a tidal wave
Get on my knees every day, I asked God and prayed
That my dirty ways don't lead me to an early grave
One life to live and it's survival of the fuckin' fittest
Here come your rivals, when you winnin', they want competition
And did I mention niggas itchin' to be opposition?
Hit they blocks with Glocks with the extensions, now ain't no tension
Told my old lady how I'm feelin', she say I'm trippin'
But she don't know I pray for love
On the block with the thugs
Prayin' a nigga show us love, but ain't no love, so we get it out the mud
Mama made me feel like I overstayed my welcome
So I packed up my shit and went for seldom, like where's the fellas?
I'm pretty sure they understand the way I feel
Hotbox the bucket, laugh about how cold the world is
Like ain't no love in this shit 'til you get rich and famous
And these hoes want rappers or ball players
It's hard to separate the fake, 'cause they chose us
Everybody showed up when we blowed up

(And that's real shit, you know what I'm sayin'?)
I pray for, uh, I pray for love (And you wonder why I question everything, man), yeah
(Every female in my life, I'm talking 'bout everything, bro, it wasn't no love in this shit)
I pray for love (It's cold, real cold, you know what I'm sayin')
I pray for love, yeah, yeah, yeah (That's it, no love in this shit)
(Tellin' you, ain't no love in this shit, dawg)
(When you succeed, that's the only love out here, my nigga)

Crazy thing is, out of all life done taught me
Before you get one win, you gotta take a thousand losses
I remember, nigga, yeah (Straight up, you know me)
How would I ever forget? How could I ever forget? (Yeah, yeah)
I remember, oh, I remember
How could I ever forget? How would I ever forget?


I remember everything, the shine and the struggle
I remember all the pain, all the grind, all the hustle
I remember elementary when pops would come and get me
And take me to the neighborhood with Valerria and Whitney
Then pops had went to prison, I remember every letter
I remember bitches playing with my heart 'cause I would let 'em
I remember what's-his-name told me, ""Bro, let's stick together""
But we couldn't stick together 'cause niggas change just like the weather
I still remember the first night when I met Mr. Raymond
I was on the block with Glocks when Uncle Dereck came to save me
Remember back in middle school when I met Derek Bailey
And he taught me how to sack that weed, stack that cheese, and save it
But I still fucked it up, I remember tryna shake back
Me and Sir Kendrick in the kitchen cookin' fake crack
I remember my first show, I remember who booked me
I remember all you opps from middle school, them niggas was pussy
I remember my first stolen car, I was with Lil Chaz
I had just jumped off the porch, but lil' bruh was moving fast
I remember when I first met Kareem, we was coolin'
A year later, we was breakin' in them houses, shootin' movies
If we catch a nigga late night, no pipe, it's a wrap
We made lil' what's-his-name jump off his bike and that's a fact
Remember when I first caught a buzz with my raps
Money came and niggas changed and stabbed me in my back
Remember when I first confessed my love and I cried
Asked you 'bout that other fuck nigga and you lied
No longer could I stand to see the truth in your eyes
So I went somewhere else to find love and you know why
Remember sitting in my cell blaming the streets
Mama came to see me, said the blame was on me
Remember Lenny died, the city cried for a week
I remember when you niggas testified on Lil C

It was trials and tribulations on the road to chasing that paper (I remember, I remember, nigga)
Seen so many faces, been so many places, caught some cases
Crazy thing is, out of all life done taught me
Before you get one win, you gotta take a thousand losses
I remember, nigga, yeah
How would I ever forget? How could I ever forget?
I remember, oh, I remember
How could I ever forget? How would I ever forget?",52

Came up riding with the strap, iron on his lap
One false move, get whacked
Got the whole hood on his back
And it's just like that
For my niggas trapped in the trap
Pray to God we all make it back, pray we all make it back
Gotta pray we all make it back
And I know it's raw that I rap
But a street nigga first
Tell the crackers free Mac Deezy
Ma, look at your son, I'm on TV
They didn't believe me
Nigga went and got it off the greezy
It's hard, but I make it look easy, a crazy achievement
Won't really fuck with no rappers
All these niggas hustling backwards
Misguiding  the youth
But long as I know the truth
That's another subject for after
And I'm riding in the Rover
12 keep on trying to pull me over
Asking a nigga if I stole it, I bought it, I own it
I remember walking to school
Catching the bus early morning, like, Ma, I ain't going
I was in the hallways roaming
But I still got my diploma, I got my diploma
Went to school all twelve years just to get a job selling donuts, man, that's crazy
I ain't with the minimum waging
I ain't with the modern day slavery
The fuck is you saying?
Told the crackers, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Had to tell 'em, ""Fuck you, pay me""
It's back to the block
Well, I guess it's back to the block
In the streets running 'round playing hooky (Hooky)
And I ain't never sold no crack, but I'm so street, I can cook it

And I know it's hard to find a way
But you're bound to see brighter days
A million dollars can't change me, nigga
'Cause hard times made me, nigga
A hard grind saved me, nigga
I got it off the pavement, nigga
I got it off the pavement, my nigga

Yeah, yeah (Okay)
Yeah, oh

Somehow I keep on losing all my friends
I came to the conclusion it's not them
Where do I go to get some peace? Tossing, turning when I sleep
Change my number every week, I got some pain that's running deep, yeah
I don't shed tears anymore, 'cause love don't live here anymore
I'm sorry, baby girl, I got to go, whether if you like it or you don't
'Cause I've been here too many times before, yeah
I wonder when they look at me, yeah
I wonder what they see
Wondering if they can see the pain underneath
Wondering if they can see the change I increased
Brother really swang it for me
We tear down their whole gang when it's beef
Leave a nigga brains in the street
50K'll have 'em swangin' for weeks
You better have that thang when they creep, yeah
And I can't get no sleep, I got to stay up
I'm in love with the streets, I can't lay up
It's like I feel myself falling, then I wake up, up
I'ma die a paper chaser
My whole life, I been running, baby
Like someone's coming, baby
I have a hard time trusting, baby
Can't trust for nothing, babe

And every time I leave, she beg for me to stay

Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)


I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah

I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving


Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh


She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  la mode, nigga

Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh


Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience


So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh",68

I wish every state had a Birmingham


I wish everybody knew all the words to ""Mama Tried""

And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky-tonks didn't have no closin' time
And I wish grandpas never died


I wish Sunday's on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
Wish the first time, seventeen, she was my everything kiss in a Chevrolet
Could happen every day

I wish everybody overseas was gonna make it home
I wish Country music still got played on Country radio


And I wish even cars had truck beds

Money conversations at the table, I speak fluently
Stay away from bad vibes, I can't see no nigga doing me
Still give a couple thousand, even though she would of did it free
They don't treat me like no rapper 'cause my vibe like I'm in the streets
I'm one of the top five, it ain't too many guys as real as me
I barely get sleep, I'm tryna make sure everybody eats
Took a trip to overseas, I'm buyin' drip in other currencies
I'm on fire right now, and it ain't somethin' that's just currently

You got problems on your head, you can chat with me
Have you runnin' around the globe chasing racks with me

Took off fast, I know they hate how I passed 'em
Don't gotta be in the grave, they throwin' dirt on your name, yeah


I heard that crime pays, uh
They think we thugs 'cause we got ice, I'm going plain jane
No matter what, at least a quarter for my main thing
Showed up on Forbes, I can't complain, I'm tryna maintain
Hop off a plane, pick up a check, then do the same thing

Stealing kisses out there in the dark

But you're gonna make me want to


Soft hands touching on me
Lighting me up like a bonfire
Your lips are making me think

Let her get me caught up, I'll never let her
When they see me pull up in that double R truck, they'll never just think that I been a felon
They would think all this fame what brought all the pain, been dealin' with this since I was eleven
I'm at odds with his man 'cause I took off his brain
And I'm steady flexin' and steppin'
I just went bought a new coupe
I ain't feelin' no pressure, cash out on a Lam'
Won't be no comparin' between me and you
Since sixteen, young nigga been rich
Nigga just turned twenty, still havin' this shit
Fuck everybody hatin', I'm as real as it gets
Leave my sons with this money, I throw out the pitch (I got you forever, lil' nigga)

Drop off the bag and I pick it up
If you want me to do it, then it's all for your love
I'ma stay in the house, I ain't going to no club
In this bitch gettin' it in, taking pain with the drugs
Ain't no love in my heart, I woke up with a mug
Who the fuck is these hoes in this bitch? Get 'em out
Cuttin' 'em off left and right, like a body, they fold
I don't like how they rock, I'ma move 'em around
That's for niggas and hoes, too
Say, ""YoungBoy, after all, can you tell me why them people chose you?""
I really don't know, fool
How the fuck did they find a young nigga who thuggin'
Who coming straight up out the bayou?
I ain't murder them niggas, please show me your witness
You get out your body, I buy you
Ones that I love treat me like a motherless infant
Can't say that I forever got you (I can't)


On a long road (Long road)
I ain't tryna find my way home
I believe I can, I know somewhere
I'll find peace all alone

Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh
Ayy, ooh, ooh, ah


Hell nah, I ain't fold, I'm a rider
Never once I changed on my partners, my day ones
Finna take that pint and pour out the bottle
Thank the ones call me the G.O.A.T., but I'm the fuckin' slime one, no",53

I just hit an opp with the stick like I'm playing pool
Hundred shots, a hundred fools, 4KTrey break all the rules
Die today if we see you, stretch 'em and watch how I move
Bitches tryna Youngboy walk, niggas tryna baller-block
Come see what I got in this car, before I shoot, I shorten the stock
Big thirty-eight, I beat a opp, big four-five and it's made by Glock
Hop out the car and escape from the cops
Spray it with the K and we tearing up the block

Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door


Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more


No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more

Y'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus
You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like ""Bang, bang, bang, bang""
'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9""
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid
I'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
Your partners is poodles
Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I'm stupid

Your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I looped it

Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry

Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey

Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta
Turn a nigga noodle to nada
Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie
This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it
I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head

I don't wannaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbe alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)


Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze
One little taste, it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)


Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
(Hello darkness, my old friend)
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)


People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser SÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¶ze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me


Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah


And before they open up the doors
I say, ""I've never seen you cry before""
You say, ""You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl""

You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me
Oh, really loved me
Oh, you really love me",62

Gotta be so complicated? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, I'm way too young to be gettin' old


And all I wanna do is look, but I can't see, baby
Who you talkin' to while you talkin' to me, baby?
Let me, let me know if I can see you later
We could make it easy


Inside my head is getting pretty cluttered (Cluttered, cluttered)
I try, but can't clean up this mess I made
'Fore I start to think about the future
First, can I please get through a day?

Hand Me Downs,Mac Miller,"I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you

It'sÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂgettin' harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place with a lake, such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it, I break it
That might just break me down


And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember, I've been keepin' it together, but I'm feelin' strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...


You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs


Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down

Yeah, well, I'm just being honest, my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time, the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turnin' 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie, though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make-believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walkin', droppin' change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity, um, I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
I guess it's like electrolytes, you help me go the distance
Not too efficient, but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again


Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...


You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs

Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy


And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', show me somethin'
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', somethin' I can see


Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That's just the way it goes, your god don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from

And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we
Show me somethin', show me somethin', show me somethin'
And all I know
If life is but a dream, then so are we

All I know is that (What?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (Yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, ""This is me without you""
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is


I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), weÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre just in too deep


You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, ""Let's meet around three""
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are getting super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't overhear us talk
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause

I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), weÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre just in too deep


We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so I keep it a hundred, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because


I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), weÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)",57

And you don't know what you should do
You just lookin' for someone to make you move, ooh, tell me (Do I?)
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken
It's so much better when you wait

Put it together then it break
All the energy it take, it never stop

Can I, can I, can I get enough?


Yeah, I never slip, I never fall

And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?
It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I dream of this moment
Will it come true?
The whole world, they know it
They just waitin' for me and you
And she, just like I
Got her head in the clouds
Don't need to be lower
Before it's all over, I promise we'll figure it out
I ain't comin' down
Why would I need to?
So much of this world is above us, baby
They might tell you that I went crazy
I'm just tryna read you
Ooh, ooh, oohh
Ooh-ooh-oohh

I know we try
And the days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow


Let it go, let it be
We're all we need today
Let it go, let it be
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm


Yeah, well
Sometimes I get lonely
Not when I'm alone
But it's more when I'm standin' in crowds
That I'm feelin' the most on my own
And I know that somebody knows me
I know somewhere there's home
I'm startin' to see that all I have to do is get up and go

Goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone
Gotta get goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone


Ayy, and I know we try
Days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow",71
Stepdad,Eminem,"Ayo
(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My,ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂstepdad


One thing thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂsticks in my craw
When I wasÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂsix and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!


I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I...

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)


So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, ""Oops"" and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""Fuck you, punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)",56

I don't know where I've been lately, but I've been alright
I said good morning this morning and I'll say good night
Don't, don't, don't, don't wait around
We'll take the stairs that gets us into there
It's unfair when I'm being too proud, but

That's on me, that's on me, I know
That's on me, that's on me, it's all my fault

Lover,Taylor Swift,"We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover


We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)

You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)

I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

Soon as she left it was hard
I wanted her here with me
She left me out with my boys
But I say, ""That's okay""
Protect my heart with that rod
I'm running far out your reach

I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you


For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it


'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you

From the unknown
I ran away, I don't think I'm coming back home
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like a crawlspace, it's a dark place I roam
Ain't no right way, just the wrong way I know
I problem-solve with Styrofoam
My world revolves around a black hole
The same black hole that's in place of my soul, uh
Empty, I feel so goddamn empty
I may go rogue
Don't tempt me, big bullet holes

A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person

I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like youÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre at the end of your rope

Just the pride talkin', isnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even ifÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even ifÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like""
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, ""It ain't Christ-like"" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, ""It ain't Christ-like""

Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said ""That ain't Christ-like""

I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
Listen, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga

The wayÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂI came in the game
The imageÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂthat I had put out
They wouldn't expect me to have feelings
Know it probably don't seem like it
That's why they talk about me like I ain't human, but we all is
But I'm still bein' me
I'm still in the streets and I'm still thuggin' until them niggas put me under, yeah
That's how we livin' and that's how we goin' out, you hear me? Open your mouth


I say, ""Mama, I'm so sorry""
I got ice burned where my heart at
On the road where I had it hard at
How I'm chosen? I'm so heartless, so, so heartless
I ain't know my age, he was sixteen, they killed Lil Dave
Mind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain
I ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man
I love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change
I pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me
They keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me
I cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe
I cannot hold on without you on side of me
I never knew this fame would take the ones I love from 'way from me
I wanna see Kacey bad, but I can't seem to call Nene
Go in with no pen and pad, I got this shit right on my sleeve
Right now my candle burning wax, I'm feelin' like it's burnin' me

I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild


I fell in love with Kaylyn, without even knowin' this bitch done snaked me
I'm missin' Yaya daily, the one who don't make me feel basic
Happiness I'm chasin', while killers behind me tryna blank me
You don't know what I'm feelin'
Or what I'm thinkin' and you can't change me
I miss my fuckin' daddy, I've been callin' Montana my father
Times been gettin' harder
I came from nothin', now, bitch, I'm royal
I call Monique my mama, but Lord knows I need Sheronda
I don't need no commas, I'm feeling like I'm going under
My paw-paw getting old, and once he gone, I'm on my own
Right now I'm all alone, I pray that grandmom keep me strong
Can't even leave my home, my bracelet beepin', plus I'm down
I just wan' be gone, my son straight, my money long
Tell me what you feelin', I hope that I can help you out
My youngins in that North, I pray that y'all gon' make it out
These bitches comin' 'round, and they don't even like my songs
I'll burn up the town, before them niggas bust my dome
I wish that I can hear Dump say, ""What up, lil' brother?"" one more time
We killin' shit and plus we dyin'
I'm gon' go out behind my brother, fuck this charge, I slang that iron
Before he go and I don't ride

I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild
I'm just a lonely child
Who need someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, my pain away
Because my thoughts been runnin' wild


Oh, oh Lord
I need some help because my life been real hard
The way I approached the game, it seem that I'm hard
But I got feelings too just like a lil' boy, oh, Lord
I'm a grandmom baby",65

Living,Dierks Bentley,"This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear


Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'


I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said ""Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough""

Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given

Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade

Rearview Town,Jason Aldean,"Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ""ya'll come back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear


It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town


I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town


It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say


It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

God's Country,Blake Shelton,"Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country


I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country


We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)


I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found

The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

(This is God's country)
God's country


I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)


I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)


Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more


And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are, then one magical night


I forgot that you existed

So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur


I forgot that you existed

Mm, mm-mm-hmm
Mm, mm-mm-hmm


Wide awake while the world is sound asleep, and
Too afraid of what might show up while you're dreamin'
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
Nobody, nobody would believe you


Every day you try to pick up all the pieces
All the memories, they somehow never leave you
Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
Nobody, nobody would believe you


God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows how it's killing you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
But God only knows the real you
There's a kind of love that God only knows

There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love


You keep a cover over every single secret
So afraid if someone saw them, they would leave
But somebody, somebody, somebody sees you
Somebody, somebody will never leave you


God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows how it's killing you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows

There's a kind of love that God only knows


There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love
There's a kind of love that
There's a kind of love

For the lonely, for the ashamed
The misunderstood, and the ones to blame
What if we could start over?
We could start over, we could start over (Over)
Oh, for the lonely, for the ashamed
The misunderstood, and the ones to blame
What if we could start over?
We could start over, we could start over
'Cause there's a kind of love that God only knows


God only knows what you've been through
God only knows what they say about you
God only knows the real you
But there's a kind of love that God only knows
God only knows what you've been through

The Archer,Taylor Swift,"Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you


Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you


I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?


Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years


I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)


'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me


All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you


I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay

Paper Rings,Taylor Swift,"The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe


(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)


I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so


(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)

I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays

Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince,Taylor Swift,"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)


No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but


It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)


No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but


It's you and me, that's my whole world

Cornelia Street,Taylor Swift,"We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar

WeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwere a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen


I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But somethin' happened, I heard him laughin'
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives


You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)


And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But, God, I love the English

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon

You know I love a London boy

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂCause the morning comes and you're not my baby

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages

It's death by a thousand cuts


My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts


I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying

I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow",83
False God,Taylor Swift,"We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'dÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂdieÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂfor you?
We wereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂstupid to jump
In the ocean separatingÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂus
Remember how IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂd fly to you?


And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith


But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
WeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂd still worship this love
WeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂd still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and weÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you


And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When youÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre led by blind faith, blind faith


But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love",79
Daylight,Taylor Swift,"My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight


Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke


Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneakin' in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burnin' red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight


I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)


I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love",85

Money ain't rich, everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight

But there's somethin' to some of it


Girls like to laugh, tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat, everybody's got a past
And love's worth livin' for
When you dance, hold her close, 'til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

What really makes you a man
Is bein' true to her

Talk You Out Of It,Florida Georgia Line,"Girl, I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' here watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe


I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it


Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind

I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it


Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad


I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower

Love Ain't,Eli Young Band,"Hotels are made for two night stays, checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't


Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't


Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark
That sad song it was written just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't


Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

I wonder what he's doing

Feeling like a fool

Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself

Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh

That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately

And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone

Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah


She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion

Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number

They said, ""Fucking right, they were the first to go""
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you""
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, ""Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?""
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home


Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now

I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names

How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?

And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all


My mother is back to who she was years ago
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say ""What up, though?""
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home

Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all

Panic-stricken, handle business, not a joke, yeah
Manners missin', travel different, no control, yeah
Time to listen, time to zip it, keep it closed
My description, highly gifted, take some notes, yeah
Lack of interest, why'd you visit? Hit the road, yeah
I'm kinda twisted, so keep your distance, be a ghost
Yeah, see I'm inventive, but quite the menace, you ain't know?
Well then I'm offended, let's jog your memories, here we go, yeah
I went from nobody to kinda famous
Hide my plaques inside the closet, I just can't explain it
My wife, she tells me that she's proud and thinks that I should hang 'em
But I just leave 'em on the ground right next to my self-hatred
Yeah, yeah, mental health, where's my mental health?
Diagnosed with OCD, what does that mean? Well, gather 'round
That means I obsessively obsess on things I think about
That means I might take a normal thought and think it's so profound (Leave me alone)
Ruminating, fill balloons up full of doubts
Do the same things, if I don't, I'm overwhelmed (Leave me alone)
Thoughts are pacing, they go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's so draining, let's move onto something else, fine (Oh) (Leave me alone)
Runnin' the game, but they don't even know it
Like I'm undercover and don't wanna blow it
I come out of nowhere, they don't even notice
The flow is so cold, you would think it was snowin' (Oh) (Leave me alone)
I'm under the weather, but wind isn't blowin'
I got an umbrella for difficult moments
You got to admit it, I'm very devoted
I'm out in the rain, but it don't always open, so I (I, I)

Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid (More afraid)
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Don't wanna change)
Tell them how I feel, but they remain the same (Same)

I hate when they debate if we're underrated
We're so overlooked that they're lookin' over our numbers, Nathan (Leave me alone)
We don't do enough interviews or go out in public lately
We don't post enough on our socials
To keep the buzz from fading (Leave me alone)
Let it fade, yeah, let it fade
Once it's decimated, then you drop a song outta nowhere
And all the fans embrace it (Leave me alone)
Then the buzz will surface again, it's part of my operation
I don't need advice from my doubts right now
End of conversation (Leave me alone)
Shut your mouth, yeah, shut your mouth
Better tone it down, close it now
If you make a sound, I'ma change the dial (Leave me alone)
Funny how they be acting loud, comin' unannounced
It's floating 'round
Man, the kid is wild, pretty vile, true (Leave me alone)
I'm kinda funny but don't really show it
I keep it together but have a disorder
I go to my room and I sit in my corner
And talk to myself in a language that's foreign (Leave me alone)

Told you I hung up, it kinda felt wrong (Leave me alone) (Wrong, wrong)
Finally called him back, we didn't talk long (No)
He asked me how I'd been, I sent him this song (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Yeah, think he took offense, he kinda seemed off (Off)
I texted him that night to ask what he thought (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
It took a couple days to get a response

The Search,NF,"""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt know, it's alright
I've been dealinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (Last night)
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funnyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs goinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (Air out)
IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm sayin', andÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be greatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnot because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist
The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh",77

I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind

And I realize


I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

Keep my exes in check in my basement

Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now


And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind


Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her

I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her


It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot

Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith


Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her

When I Grow Up,NF,"Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?
Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal

When I grow up, I just want to pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just want to make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
I just want to sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up


Yeah, ayy
When I grow up
Yeah, yeah, ayy


I'ma make 'em notice me, rhymin' like it's poetry
Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? ""No""
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, ""No""
Come on, I can spit it really fast, ""No""
You think I should throw this in the trash? ""No""
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough
I'ma have to try it, though

When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just wanna make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
(Leave it to the fam in the will)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Okay, oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills (Woo)
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
(Yeah, the way I feel)
Yeah, I just wanna make a couple mil' (Ayy, couple mil')
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah, to the fam in the will)
I just wanna sign a record deal (Woo)
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)

Yeah, I might not be the best in my field

Eyes On You,Chase Rice,"We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault


No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)


Speakin' of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)


Don't you remember Times Square?
And people countin' down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause, baby, you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare


No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl, you know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you",70

Hands on your body, I'm grabbin' your ass
Enjoyin' the moment 'cause life move too fast
I'm lookin' forward, ignorin' the past
These are the times that we'll laugh lookin' back
I'm gettin' lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters, I'm wishin' you well
This is my year, man, if you couldn't tell


This is our life and we livin' it well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell

If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right


Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive

This energy turns nights into memories (Oh yeah)
Count up the bands, you've been workin' all summer
Ex didn't know what he had, what a bummer
Insecure people turn to insecure lovers
Well, my drink is almost out and I'm about to pour another


Just let it out
The night has just begun, we on a level now
If I get too fucked up, promise you'll hold me down
Yeah, this that shit you can't deny

Here Tonight,Brett Young,"Hmm, if ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go


We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight


I just wanna linger like this on your lips
And taste the salt air on your skin
Hold you in my hands
Anything and everything, you know that I'm all in


We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while
I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight
Baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, yeah
Oh, let's just stay right here tonight

'Cause I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go
We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time
Let the world spin on without us for a while


I'm tellin' you, we're just one kiss away from heaven
So baby, hold on tight
'Cause I want to get wrapped up in your love
So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight

Be Alright,Dean Lewis,"I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face


And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""


So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""


But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find


""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright",80

Make It Sweet,Old Dominion,"I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul-sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got


'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet


Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there


'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be

Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me

Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight

I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs a shotta, shotta
Cold-hearted nigga, with the blocka-blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?


When I'm in traffic gotta slide with the beam on me
'Cause I keep 'bout ten racks bussin' out the jeans on me
Niggas be hatin', I'm rich, it's all about the cream, homie
If I ever get caught lackin', they gon' slide
Ever since I got the Rollie, I ain't got the time
Flawless diamonds, niggas can't never block the shine
They know I'm ballin' in the city like DeRozan
Gotta keep my niggas 'round me, I can't do the wrong friends
I was knockin' down walls, now they closin' in
Hopped off the porch, and then I hopped inside the Porsche, ayy
Fuck being the side nigga, I'ma be the main course
Whipped the Rolls like a young nigga made for it

I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs a shotta, shotta

I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?


Tryna get my bag, I had to go and make it happen
Me and my dogs, we was bussin' out them bandos
Count out them hunnids, then we throw it in the mattress
Wrap it in plastic, and throw it in the attic
I be in the streets, nigga, I stand ten toes
Any nigga in my situation would've been fold
We was trappin' out the basement, made it back tenfold
Gotta stay out the way, that's why I'm always behind the tint for
We was fightin' fed cases, 'member I was 2 and 0
Nigga was fightin' depression, sippin' syrup, I was movin' slow
I was down below, but still, I always kept my head up
Nigga gotta get my bread up, I don't wanna die young
No, no, no


I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga

Better Now,Post Malone,"You prolly think that you are better now, better now

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh


I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

This Is It,Scotty McCreery,"Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high

Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, we're not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes


This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it


Girl, I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well, I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee


This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it

Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile

At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you


Honestly, this party's over
Everyone here shoulda gone home
But I'm afraid of being sober
'Cause the first thing I do when I'm alone


I start touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do?
So I squeeze out the lime on the ice of my drink
And the juice hits the cuts on my fingers
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you


Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

I'm afraid to turn the lights on
I don't wanna face this rebound
Is it weird if I come over?
I want to, but I know that she's around


So I'm touching myself to the photos that you used to send me
I should have deleted, but kept it a secret
Is that crazy to do? (Haha)
Oh, I'm hungry and wasted and my hands are shaking
I shouldn't be cooking, but spilling hot water
It still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you


Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you


Been through every emotion
Right now, I'm sad and broken
Like the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up
Wish I could get a little un-drunk
So I could, I could un-love you

Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you
At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you
But some things you can't undo
I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers
So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper
But some things you can't undo
And one of them's you

There Was This Girl,Riley Green,"Never knew my old man's truck could even run like that
Should've known better than to take that curve so fast
Daddy pulled up, I was down in a ditch
And he asked me why I did what I did


There was this girl, drink in her hand
Shootin' me a ""Let's get into trouble"" grin
I ain't never seen somethin' so fine
And I was doin' anything to make her mine
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl


Some folks ask me why I still pick this guitar
They say livin' that life on the road won't get you very far
I say man you should've been down in Tupelo
Seen what was in the front row


There was this girl, beer in her hand
Shootin' me a ""Play a little Skynyrd"" grin
She's turnin' it up, she's turnin' me on
And I'd play her anything she'd sing along
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl

Didn't know a diamond ring could cost so much (Damn)
Took six months on a farm 'fore I saved up
All my drinkin' buddies still out on the town
Wonderin' why I ever settled down


But there was this girl, holdin' my hand
Shootin' me a ""Start a life together"" grin
She's pullin' me in, she straightened me out
And now I know what love is all about
I'm still out of my mind, she's still out of this world
There was this girl

Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?

Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

That makes me a millionaire


I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire


When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say ""That boy is sure livin' in luxury""
Sweet luxury


'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire



When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare

Hit the beach in LA like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo truck, you start it up and skrrt off
We park after dark at the park by the mansion, take your skirt off
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
My heart is racing, every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate making love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feelin'
Yes, girl you're the best, take away stress, love me to death
Even when I'm a mess

Calling My Spirit,Kodak Black,"I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank


Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm from we donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit

Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it

What gives ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂem the right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth


You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ on the rain

Everybody doin' their own thing


I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country


Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country


Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out


I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not have been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

You do your kind of country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country",62

Burn Out,Midland,"Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out


Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here


Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out


If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out

Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around


Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now

Fast a cigarette can burn out

You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared

It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of stayin' above the risin' water line


Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same ol' storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darlin', I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow
Hangin' over your head


If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red, and orange, and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat, take off your coat
And take a look around

Gotta tell The WIZRD, it's a story like a book
Tears in my eyes

Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth


Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences


Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it


Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm


Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences


Yeah, loving you",66

I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around

So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long

To see if reindeer really know how to fly

I know I'm God-sent
This gotta be God


I'm God-sent, like He sent me up so I can relay these messages

Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us (Woo)
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night
Then, tell me, why you actin' cold to me?

Dreamin' of a fire


Uh, my mama used to pray that she'd see me in Yale
It's fucked up she gotta see me in jail
On the visit with Lil Papi, it hurt even though I seemed to be well
They got a smoker with a key to my cell, damn
And even worst, my judge black don't wanna see me do well
It's either that or black people for sale
Gave me two to four years like, ""Fuck your life, meet me in hell""
And let it burn like Lucifer, you look even stupider
Tryna impress them people in power when power abusin' us
For 44 dollars a hour, you coward they using ya
Is it self-hate that made you send me upstate?
This where the so-called ""real niggas"" sweeping up for cupcakes
And that's your phone time, if you ain't got no money, you ain't online
Hey call your son, call your daughter just to wish them more prime
Oh God, don't let them streets get a hold of 'em
Your daughter fuckin' now, it's gon be a cold summer
Your son trapping, and your homie giving O's to him
And if he fuck that paper up, he puttin' holes through him
And you just wanna make it home, so you can show it to him
And them people ain't finna give no parole to ya
They want blood, we all hangin' with a noose on our neck
My celly mom just died, he wanna use my collect
And he won't make it to the wake unless he give 'em a check
We still niggas though, what you expect?

I just won
I was on the corner with the reefa
And they got us warring for our freedom
See my brother blood on the pavement
How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
Uhh, trauma
When them drugs got a hold of your mama
And the judge got a hold on your father
Go to school, bullet holes in the locker


Ain't no PTSDs, them drugs keep it at ease
They shot that boy 20 times when they could've told him just freeze
Could've put him in a cop car, but they let him just bleed
The ambulance, they coming baby, just breathe
That's what the old lady said when she screamed
This nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th
And in the 13th amendment, it don't say that we kings
They say that we legally slaves if we go to the bing
They told Kaep' stand up if you wanna play for a team
And all his teammates ain't saying a thing (Stay woke)
If you don't stand for nothing, you gon' fall for something
And in the 60's, if you kneeled, you'd prolly be killed
But they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal
Kill your account, look where money get spilled
Check it, and they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal
Kill your account, look where money get spilled

I just won
I was on the corner with the reefa
And they got us warring for our freedom
See my brother blood on the pavement
How you wake up in the mornin' feelin' evil?
Uhh, trauma
When them drugs got a hold of your mama
And the judge got a hold on your father
Go to school, bullet holes in the locker


How many times you send me to jail to know that I won't fail
Invisible shackles on the king, 'cause shit, I'm on bail
I went from selling out arenas, now shit, I'm on sale
Them cold nights starting to feel like hell, uhh
Watching a black woman take my freedom
Almost made me hate my people
When they label you felon, it's like they telling you they not equal
11 years going to court knowing they might keep you or drive you crazy
23 hours in a cell, somebody save me
I'm on a jail call, trying to explain it to my baby
I gotta do the calendar twice, and that's a maybe

You gotta tell 'em put them guns and them percs down
Them new jails got ten yards in 'em and that's your first down, uh
And I ain't come here to preach
I just had to say somethin' 'cause I'm the one with the reach
Youngin' gotta quarter ounce, he tryna turn into Meech
Ain't had no daddy, he's had to learn from the streets
I used to be a honor roll student, damn
Then I turned to a beast
The first time I seen a nigga get some blood on his sneaks
He had on Air Max 93s but was slumped in the street
His mama cryin', that did somethin' to me, oh Lord
The shit I'm doin' for my hood I won't get an award
I used to sell Reggie, damn how' I get to the Forbes?
I take a shot, if I miss I'm gettin' them boards
Ain't quittin' no more, like give me some more
We wearing Old Navy, it felt like Christian Dior
Was dead broke but rich in soul, was we really that poor?
Was we really that dumb? 'Cause we carry a gun
And every nigga in my neighborhood carryin' one
'Cause we had nightmares of our mamas gotta bury her son
I'm speakin' to you as a prophet as rare as they come, uh

Ridin' for these niggas like that shit ain't hurt my mom or somethin'
Only one gon' get me commissary or even buy me somethin'
When it all fall down
I can't call y'all now
Even if I hit your phone
That won't get me home
Seen so many different times, these niggas did me wrong
Shit that's the reason that I did this song

Shit we was kids used to play on the step
A couple years later we flirtin' with the angel of death
I was 11 years old, I got my hands on the TEC
When I first touched it that shit gave me a rush
My homie's dying I'm like ""Maybe we next""
That just made me a threat
Knowin' the niggas smoke my daddy it just made me upset
Made me a man shit I was five when God gave me my test
Go to court with a court appointed and he won't say he objects
Now it's you against the state and you ain't got no cake
Jail overpopulated they ain't got no space
I know a young'un that got murked ain't get to drive no Wraith
But he in the hearse on the way to church, I know his mom gon' faint
When she smell like embalment fluid, cologne all on her baby
Pastor said he sendin' you home, she goin' crazy
When they drop that casket all in the ground, who gon' save me?
How could you blame me? When I'm tryna stay alive and just survive and beat them odds when niggas die by twenty-five
When I stop fearin' for my life, when I decide to change my mind And stop totin'
Tryna smoke the pain away, they lock us up for smoking
Put 'em on probation, lock 'em up if you ain't perfect
Victim to the system like a rain drop in the ocean
They closin' all the schools and all the prisons gettin' open


Yeah
See comin' from where I come from
We had to beat the streets
Beat the system, beat racism, beat poverty
And now we made it through all that we at the championship",52

I ain't have nobody to give me no hope
I hope my momma ain't doin' no coke
I used to wish that my daddy was livin'
I had a dream that I seen him as ghost
I used to act up when I went to school
Thought it was cool, but I really was hurt
Wanted my family to come to my games
My mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work
Lived with my grandma, she took me to church
Really no I ain't wanna go
Remember I kissed my aunt in the casket
And her forehead was cold
I was like 4 years old
We couldnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt afford no clothes
It was hand me down
Who would think a nigga get a Grammy now?
Got a black judge tryna tear me down
All this jail time probably wear me down

Screaming, ""Bloody, Bloody, Bloody Mary"" now

Had to see the footage on a camera, man
On the pavement, with his brains out

Poor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier
Lot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail
Lot of sons growin' up and repeating them
This the belly of the beast, you won't make it out
Man, this shit was designed just to eat us up
And my momma told, ""Nigga, keep it up
You gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up""
Remember, nobody never believed in us
When they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no

I think it's funny how
We used to go to school, play SEGA's
And then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with Glock .40s
We ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us


Yeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects
What they gon' do with us? Can't call the cops yet
You might just get popped at
'Cause they the ones shootin' us
I'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat
The violence pursuing us, I ain't meet God yet
'Cause I'm on the block where
It's just me and Lucifer, look what they do to us
They know we in poverty
When I went to court, the judge said, ""Meek, you a menace to society""
Huh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?
16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh
Whole hood goin' crazy, babies havin' babies
She was fourteen, actin' like she eighty
Got pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages
And the story goes on, if you make it, you amazing (Word up)


See, I got homie that's a billionaire

Just you in the grotto
With nothin' but your nights on
Keep the fuckin' lights on
Same again tomorrow
We don't need no bottle
Purple color lip-gloss
Room at The Saguaro
Ain't nowhere I would rather be
Right between your holidays
Coffee on the flintstone
Jewelry on the ottoman
Baby, let me in, oh
For I get way too adamant about it
Love the way you shiver
Dig in to my shoulder blades
Feel it when you quiver
Higher level, elevate
You could be the renegade
Bonnie to a Clyde
Harrelson and Juliette
Legends never die

Probably got a shorted cable
Way too busy fuckin' on the sofa or the kitchen table

Kinda like a hurricane
Sweepin' through the desert
Hot Americana rain fallin'
Wearing nothing but my Lauryn Hill shirt
It's kinda baggy on you, baby, but it work
The AC hasn't worked in ages
I could probably read the label
Way too busy fuckin' on the counter or the coffee table

Hotel Key,Old Dominion,"Well, it was down some street we couldn't even pronounce
We were smoking a little from a half an ounce
The tequila was cheap but the flow we were feeling was real
Neither one of us looking for three little words
Unless those three words were ""do not disturb""
Checkout was supposed to be noon but we slept in 'til three


She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key


Well, I could still see her on the bed sitting Indian style
With my t-shirt on and a half drunk smile
She talked about Austin and how she'd get back there someday
We had the curtains wide open and a song on my phone
We danced by the TV we never turned on
And wondered would anyone miss us if we ran away?
But this isn't one of those stories that ends up that way, no


She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah

We left the lights
We left the crowd
We left the world and locked it out
She left a picture in my head
She left the night I can't forget, but


She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more
She kept the hotel key
Yeah, she kept it
She kept the hotel key
Slipped it in her purse
I guess, it makes her think of me
And that night we left our hearts on our sleeves and the clothes all over the floor
We both know we can't open the door no more

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who

But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)

Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat

My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked

Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin'ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂoh

Drunk Girl,Chris Janson,"Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow
In and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows
She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home

She's bouncing like a pinball
Singing every word she never knew
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
Her hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home


Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home


You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that little bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighborÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did

Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on walk out and lock the door
That's how ya know the difference between a boy and man
You take a drunk girl home


You took a drunk girl home
In the sober light of dawn
She left you a message she thanks you on the phone
'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor
You left the hall lights on walked out and locked the door
That's how she knows the difference between a boy and man
Take a drunk girl home

You take a drunk girl home

Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong

To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see

Africa,Weezer,"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""


It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have


The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become


It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never have



Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you

There's nothing you can ever hide

Like you'll never lose me
Steady claiming that everyone know we together

Put you on do not disturb and entertain these dudes
I'ma ride him crazy and you'll never have a clue

I'ma text Lorenzo and, I'ma leave you cryin'

Now you tellin' me that I should fight it
Why you be out here playing the victim
When I am the one who been cryin'?
Why dish it out but can't take it?
I want revenge, I can't fake it
Wanna see the look on your face
When I drop my clothes and I get naked (30Hertz straight up)

Now tell me, player, how does that make you feel? (Make you feel?)
How could you play me when the love I gave was real? (Oh, baby)

Boy, you ain't gon' ever learn
Play with fire, you get burned

Until I hit you where it hurts

And headed straight for the pier

'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer

Open Letter,Lil Wayne,"Ah-em


Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
TalkinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtil they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I wonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs power, yes, it's now or next
CanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?


Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question


You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that.",51

Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump

Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like ""let's play,"" lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm

I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless

She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost

Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂem

Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt stress out""

Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""


Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
Let it all work out (Phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, ""Remember this:"")
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""And don't forget what I did this, bitch"")
""Let it all work out""

""Let it allÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ""

I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
Safe code now nigga, cough it up or spit it out
Oh my God I'm flipping out, flipping out then dipping out
I tried to turn the fuckin' page, oh my God, I ripped it out

I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?


I used to know you niggas, I don't know you niggas
I just ignore you niggas, I don't bro you niggas
With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

I used to smoke to get high now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the beast side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

Mmm...


I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up


And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up


Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

I don't know who you are anymore

I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, ""Pray""
She say, ""I need a day"", I said, ""I need a bae""
She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""

I donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm

CanÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard


God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt let me drown

Don't let me drown, drown, drown
And keep my head above water, above water
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown

And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breathe


God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waitin'
I'm too young to fall asleep
So, God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown
And keep my head above water, above water

Perfect,Ed Sheeran,"I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me


'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight


Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight


No, no, no
Mm, no, no


Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms

And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'


Ah


Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain 'cause all these girls the same, love

Fall,Eminem,"(Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire

Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on myÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ


Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tapeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂguess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid"" (Yah)
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away (Woo)
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY (Yeah)
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once (Yeah!)
You wanted Shady? You got him!

Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Ha)


Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly (Yeah)
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!"" (Huh?)ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂKathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂGabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Haha)

Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Haha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)


Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I'ma have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew (Ah!)
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the Hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (Yeah)

It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud

Life Changes,Thomas Rhett,"Waking up in my college dorm
Yeah, my life, it was pretty normal
Looking for a date to the spring formal
Wasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no
Majoring in Undecided
Notebook full of bad songs I was writing
Never dreamed anybody else would like them
Now they're sitting on a Walmart shelf


Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no


I bought a ring and she said, ""I do""
But everybody else said, ""Man, you're twenty-two
Whatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?""
'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah
And now she got her own set of fans
She got a blue check mark by her Instagram
And I wrote a little song about holding her hand
And now everybody wanna die a happy man

Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing
Life changes
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no
And I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no


I remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama
""You're gonna have a grandkid, yep
From Uganda, that's right, we're adopting
And she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen""
Well, I was wrapping my head around being a dad
A big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had
Now Lauren's showing, got one on the way
Yeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?


Ain't it funny how life changes
You wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes
You can't stop it, just hop on the train, and
You never know what's gonna happen
You make your plans and you hear God laughing

Hooked,Dylan Scott,"It was a Friday night
No cover but the cover band was sounding right
But there you were
Just flirty dancing
By the neon sign

Reeling in my heart

Getting you turned on
Buzzing and loving on you

Hair falling in your eyes

Still asleep and I could leave, but no way

Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah

Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂbout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm talkinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ, lil' bitch
IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck yÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂall are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ³s
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orangeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂoh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date"" ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners",67

So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is


You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty


Oh no, you canÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt dress it up in lace or rhinestones
It don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A picture of pain, so let it flow like a river


You can pretty lie and say it's okay
You can pretty smile and just walk away
Pretty much fake your way through anything
But you can't cry pretty

You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty


Oh no, you can't
Ooh, yeah


You can't turn off the flood when the dam breaks
When all your mascara is going to waste
When things get ugly, you just gotta face
That you can't cry pretty


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woo
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh yeah, woo, woo
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah",50

Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)
While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)

I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)
From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt
Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that
Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it (Get it)
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is


Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is a footÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂoh yeah, it's my dick

You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do

Swear to God, I'm down if you're down, all you gotta say is ""Right"" (Yeah-yeah)
Girl, anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine

On the beat who ever did it
Mike WiLL the one who made it
It's Shady on the lyrics


I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'
At anything that may stand in they way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my CAT scan that day (Yeah!)
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray

To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain (Ayy)
Feel like I'm headed for the padded cell, the
Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are looked at as a failure (Yeah)

Give you a shoutÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂnow get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time took
And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget though, and jump out the window
Somebody better child-proof it (Yeah)
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit (Bitch!)
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot
That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever

Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension (Woo)
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (Yeah)
Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
Bet you I come back twice as bad (Uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back
'Til I run out of gunpowder and split the scene (Pew)
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips are the clips, got the Sig lit like it's nicotine
Trigger me and Slim gets mean (Brr!)
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M16s (Woo!)
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee
You ain't harmin' a thing
I hit a ding (Ding!) hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling (Ow!)

SheÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs about to let the demons out
She don't wanna see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is howÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess beinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ weird's normal


And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 9-1-1 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikable and shifty?
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
To a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't s'posed to agree, you fucking bitch!
'Specially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognized me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window (*Beep-Beep*)
I hit a light pole, you skirt off
And then pull up at 5 a.m. in the drive in a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo (Ow! Ah)
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you ""You're the apple of my eye,"" so shut your pie hole

Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?",57
Stepping Stone,Eminem,"Take me to the river
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


It's 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof
We wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse
We were so bulletproofÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwrote, souped, and soaked in our youth
Thought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
How to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds
I just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group
Shoot!


If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones


It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
And I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in
Been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me, Biz, ""Rockstar"" was the shit
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
If you'da put D12 on it, wish I coulda did
Porter tried talkin' you into comin' up off it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET
And the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed

If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind


I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones


Bacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is startin' to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops, little drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get
For turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva, and Swift?
A Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none
I just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this
To my partners, I can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you men
But I just can't be the guy everybody depends
On for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair
I will always be here, but that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that era
I've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air
I'm barely chartin' myself
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over

I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From it I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
End up runnin' back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones


I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones",57

Get Along,Kenny Chesney,"Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, said ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain


Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?


Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?


Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

We find out when you die the keys to Heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to


Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can

Growing Pains,Alessia Cara,"You're on your own, kid
You are


Make my way through the motions, I try to ignore it
But home's looking farther the closer I get
Don't know why I can't see the end
Is it over yet? Hmm
A short leash and a short fuse don't match
They tell me it ain't that bad, ""Now, don't you overreact""
So I just hold my breath
Don't know why I can't see the sun when young should be fun (Fun)


And I guess the bad can get better
Gotta be wrong before it's right
Every happy phrase engraved in my mind
And I've always been a go-getter
There's truth in every word I write
But still, the growing pains, growing pains
They're keeping me up at night


Hey, hey, hey, hey

Starting to look like Ms. Know-It-All can't take her own advice
Can't find pieces of my peace of mind
I cry more than I want to admit
But I can't lie to myself, to anyone
'Cause phoning it in isn't any fun
Can't run back to my youth the way I want to
The days my brother was quicker to fool
AM radio, not much to do
Used monsters as an excuse to lie awake
Now the monsters are the ones that I have to face

I went and copped the chopsticks, put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit, box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many of them coulda did it with finesse?

Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga


The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course

Have It All,Jason Mraz,"May you have auspiciousness and causes of success
May you have the confidence to always do your best
May you take no effort in your being generous
Sharing what you can, nothing more nothing less
May you know the meaning of the word happiness
May you always lead from the beating in your chest
May you be treated like an esteemed guest
May you get to rest, may you catch your breath


And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow


Well here's to the hearts that you're gonna break
Here's to the lives that you're gonna change

I want you to have it all


Oh! I want you to have it all
I want you to have it
I want you to have it all

May you be as fascinating as a slap bracelet
May you keep the chaos and the clutter off your desk
May you have unquestionable health and less stress
Having no possessions though immeasurable wealth
May you get a gold star on your next test
May your educated guesses always be correct
And may you win prizes shining like diamonds
May you really own it each moment to the next

And may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
And may the road less paved be the road that you follow

I Was Jack (You Were Diane),Jake Owen,"It was yesterday
It was years ago
We were singing every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs could save our souls
Somehow, someway
We was falling fast
We was jumping in
Blue jean halo hanging off the limb
Two American kids just like them
Every time they played
And it blew us away


Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, and the music played

Yeah, we were never growing up and growing old
Breaking up or letting go
Girl's just like Rock-n-Roll
Where has it gone?
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holding on to 16 as long as you can
Every time that it comes on


Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane


Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Does it still move you?
Baby, Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane


Yeah, way back
Way on back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, let the memories take you back
Take you back
Take you back",61

Whatever It Takes,Imagine Dragons,"Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this


Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up


Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this


Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes


Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

Sober,Demi Lovato,"I got no excuses for all of these goodbyes
Call me when it's over 'cause I'm dying inside
Wake me when the shakes are gone
And the cold sweats disappear
Call me when it's over and myself has reappeared


I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely


Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore
And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor
To the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before
I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore


I'm sorry to my future love for the man that left my bed
For making love the way I saved for you inside my head
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again
I wanna be a role model, but I'm only human

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I do it every, every, every time
It's only when I'm lonely
Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
Just hold me, I'm lonely


Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore

One Number Away,Luke Combs,"Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines


Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice


IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on


Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door


And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice


And I'm one number away
From calling you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort

I made sure I held you close to me


So call out my name (Call out my name)

I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough

Guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
Maybe you should take a look in your rear view

And don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong I stood by your side?
No I guess not, I guess not, 'cause you let them thots take my spot

Go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)

I remember when you said that you could have somebody better
And I can't even lie to you it really messed my head up
Had me lookin' in the mirror disgusted with myself
Wishin' that I looked like someone else
Like the girls you liked on Instagram (damn)
And you really had the nerve to call me insecure

You, oh


Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You, oh, ayy


Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

You've got me feÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)

Me and all the guys found a better way

There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be

All wanna see me with no pot to piss in

Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions

How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby

Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', ""What have you done lately?""
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ He isÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¦ did that ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ but obviously it takes timeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ You're chattin' shit. First of all you shouldn't have no problems at the beginning, it should be like honeymoonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

Is There More,Drake,"Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas?""
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah

Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (Feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (Tempt me)

From pushing a lawn mower around

Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be


Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful

'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how Heaven, Heaven
Could be better than this

Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

Been trav'lin' in packs that I can't carry anymore
Been waitin' for somebody else to carry me
There's nothin' that's there for me at my door

There would be nobody else to save
And I can't change into a person I don't wanna be, so

And every mornin' when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn't say I'd ever been
But it's so much more than I ever was
If every night I go to sleep knowin'
That I gave everything that I, I had to give
Then it's all I could've asked for
I've been standing up beside everything I've ever said, but
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscin' 'bout bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs, I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't got to act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missin' out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past (Phew)
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag (Brr)
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task (Bap, bah-bah-bah)
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds (Whew)
Go to shoot and try to run (Grr)
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down (Bap, baow)
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound (Boom, shh)
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down (Lay it down)
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to Hell, knock out your brain quick (Yeah)
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit (That bang shit)
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open (Bust it open)
That Soulja Slim, that C-Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier (Word, word, word)
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin' (Steady rollin')
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me (Who?)
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep (Baow)
Bitch, I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets (Gang)
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet (Brrt, bah)
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in (Man)
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in (Turn me in)
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm screamin', ""Fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end""
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for? (What they hatin' for?)
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though? (Snatch my chain though)
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (Shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (Fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow
What's the 4-1-1? They know YB, I be 'bout whatever
You ain't got no bodies, you ain't 'bout it, boy, you are not a stepper
You play with me, bitch ain't no hidin', ain't nobody can help you
Send your ass to the Devil, in envelope like a letter
Got a FN with a clip with different colors up in it

All my roads led to her

So tonight I will fall down on my knees
'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am
I'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs

IDGAF,Dua Lipa,"You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong


So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why


You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck


I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why


You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck


I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck


About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why


You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
(Boy, I don't give a)


I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me (get to me)
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck",81

Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done ""specially invited guest""'d me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, ""Let's be out""
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame

Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game

I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
Peace is somethin' that starts with me (With me)
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy than to feel worthless
But, peace is somethin' that starts with me (With me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
Oh, things ain't like before
Ain't no stoppin' you, no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed andÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

You Make It Easy,Jason Aldean,"Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs


Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me


You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy


You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell


You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy

I'm caught in it again, see 'em all strapped in and can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me 'cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission, God, shine your love on me, save me, please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long, ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookin' out nowhere, where's home? I done hit a nerve
Pain in my eyes, every time I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God, shine your love on me, save me, please

Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully, Alice Johnson will inspire men

Violent Crimes,Kanye West,"Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see


Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off


Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' mÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©nages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel


If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough

If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right
I'mma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy)
'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find
That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now
No rush, but if he ever singles you up


He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in (Walked in)
But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you
Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along (Singing along)

People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table

I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you

I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)

All you gotta do is speak on Ye

And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got ""Malone"" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'


Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one


Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?


Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you


When was the last time you did something for the first time?
Yeah, let yourself go, baby, follow that feeling
Maybe something new is what you're needing
Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

I hope I ain't reading wrong

Most People Are Good,Luke Bryan,"I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot


I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good


I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose


I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last


I believe most people are good
And most Mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks

The Games We Play,Pusha T,"Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love


This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race


These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes


To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
My numbers lookin' like a bank code

These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes


Ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
With Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
Who grew up on legends from outta Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out


These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah!",62

Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this

And fuckin' yo bitch like its part of my ritual
Pardon the visual
But money, it give me a hard-on it's typical
I want it in physical
A million dollars, I count up in intervals
Without it I'm miserable
Don't wanna fall off so I'm all in my bag
Thankin' God like it's biblical
I know it's gon' solve every problem I have
I balled on the principal
Remember the teachers was all on my ass
Now look all of them, pitiful
And all of a sudden I'm so good at math

A hole in your heart
Fuck it, I take the whole cake and I won't leave a portion
It's only an organ
Thank God mama couldn't afford the abortion
The loneliest orphan
I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
My Rollie is scorchin'
Them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin'

Yo' girl gon' cheat on you for nothing, so I'm done with these bitches
I think about it every minute, ain't stoppin' my mission
On my payroll I got hittas, I pay 'em commision
Interrogated by detectives, won't tell 'em I did it
I told Montana that I love him, on Dave I meant it
Put twenty thousand on his head, they catch him, I send it
Get on my knee on side the bed like ""Father, forgive me""
Was sellin' weed, fucked up my profit, I ain't make a dolla
The fame gettin' to my niggas, I cut off my partners
Before I call on you, I put my trust up in this choppa
Movin' like he can't get touched real quick, I bet I stop 'em
Nigga ain't give me shit but hand out like I owe him something
I don't give a fuck, if we step together, I'll show you something
Bitches think they slick, they all deceive so I'll never love 'em
Bre was my first love but she changed so I'll never trust her

They don't give a fuck 'bout how I feel, they don't know my problems
Just 'cause you around me, I ain't forget 'bout everything you said
I let some shots off in the air for my niggas dead
Do anything in the world for you, I'm livin' red
Showin' love to them niggas, they might bust my head
Mad 'bout a gun, but for a fact bitch I won't do you nothin'
Mad that I'm up but you remember, you ain't give me nothing
I ain't give up on my mission, fuck you mean bitch? I was steady hustlin'
Handin' all you niggas money bitch, and I was steady strugglin'
Montana know about my pain and everything I told him
I told him watch what he was saying, but shit I had to fold him
Up in that cell, bitch I was cryin' with no one to hold me
YoungBoy a soldier, I remember what my grampa told me


Batty boy if you cross, I'ma take your life

Dreaming 'bout being a big star

I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down


Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂmy hands are full

Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you

Feels like we're on the edge right now

All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down


Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy

Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down

Might be over now, but I feel it still

Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still


Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies
Or we could wait until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now)
It's time to give a little to the kids in the middle
But, oh, until it falls, won't bother me


Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?


Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse now
Might be over now, but I feel it still


Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I've been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

The Long Way,Brett Eldredge,"Don't think I've ever seen your kind of pretty
Wandering around this midnight mad house city
You got a look that says you've got it all together
So if you don't mind, I'd like to know you better


Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around


I'd love to see just where your daddy met your momma
Your hand-me-down '99 Impala
Show me the field you danced in Clover
The harvest in October
When the leaves fall from the sky just like a Sunday drive


Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want the secrets you keep, the shine underneath
Of the diamond I think I just found
Take me the long way around

Didn't think tonight when I walked in
I'd be falling for somewhere I've never been


Take me the long way around your town
Were you the queen with the silver crown?
I want your red blushing stories
Your faults and your glories
That made you who you are right now
Take me the long way around
Take me the long way around",58

Get Up 10,Cardi B,"Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (Bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (Yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (Facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (Hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (Say it)
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (Huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (Skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (Facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (Huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (No)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (Cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced (Laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (Fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (Fucked up shit)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this (Woo)
I walked into the label, ""Where the check at?"" (""Where the check?"")
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (Bad ass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (Try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that ""blap"" sound (Blap!)

Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten

Five More Minutes,Scotty McCreery,"Eight years old, a couple cane poles
Sittin' down by the creek
Our lines in the water, watching those bobbers
Seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling ""Supper's hot
Y'all come and get it!""
We yelled five more minutes


At sixteen it was twelve o three
Standin' at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight
But we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off
Interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes


Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes

At eighteen, turned my helmet in
And walked to the fifty-yard line
It's just the coach and me after we
Lost state, ten to nine
And I cried, ""Man next time to get in here
I'll have to buy a ticket""
Can't you give me five more minutes?


Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times

Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button

And give myself five more minutes


At eighty-six, my grandpa said
There's angels in the room
With all the family gathered 'round
We knew that time was coming soon
With so much left to say I prayed
Lord, I ain't finished
Just give us five more minutes

Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying

No Roots,Alice Merton,"I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I grow old, I hope I won't forget to find them
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night


I build a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night


And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times


I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground

I've got no roots

I like standing still but that's just a wishful plan
Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night


I count gates and numbers, then play the guessing game
It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night


And a thousand times I've seen this road
A thousand times


I've got no roots
But my home was never on the ground

Grippin' this grain, I spit to release the pain
Pimpin' ain't a thang, what's good?
Hold up, let me get it right, I been contemplating life
I been grindin' on a fight, I been writin' on a flight
Roll up on 'em like that Backwood
Better act good or get smacked good
I'm just tryna live life, I'm just tryna get right
Anybody got advice?
I know I'm a workaholic but everybody got a vice
I leave 'em diminished
And I do not know if you know
That I am so ahead of my time
That my whole motherfuckin' discography's already finished
The greatest alive, bitch, I been it
Now go on your business, can I get a witness?
Been smoking and drinking a little bit
There's levels to the litness


Pull up with that new-new in the driveway
So fresh, I double park that bitch sideways
When it comes to life, I do it my way
Smoked out 180 on the highway
Yeah, I'm sittin' shotgun
Gotta let my shawty drive
I'm too alive, leave that pussy crucified
It's just you and I
You know it's do-or-die

Hold up, wait a minute, bring it right back
Mix that real with that turn up, call it BoomTrap
I ain't heard no shit like this in so long
I don't know how this right here could go wrong
This is my theme song, me and my team's song
I got millions in the bank because my dream's strong
I don't sip the syrup, I got friends to lean on
But I get my green on, yes, I get my green on
Pull up in this bitch and smoke a O
Like woah, goddamn
Yeah, that boy, he been on the low
About to blow, about to show
About to show 'em, I don't know 'em
I don't know 'em, no, I don't know 'em
I don't know, I don't
I vibe wit' 'em, I ride wit' 'em
If they down wit' me, you know I die wit' 'em

Yours,Russell Dickerson,"I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going nowhere with no one but me
I was one in a hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
Everyone else shines out but me


But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours


I was a worn out set of shoes
Wandering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

But I came to life when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heartbeat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

Shawty was there 'fore I had them bands
She a lil' rider just like her friend
Her and her mama, cool as a fan
I love a woman, who love her man
What can I say? She realer than most
When things get ugly, she don't get ghost
The ship was sunkin', she stayed on the boat
I call her bae but to me, she the GOAT

She my lil' rock, what's mine is hers
Like shawty told me, ""what's mine is yours""
She more than a hundred, that ain't even a word
Things go left, I hit her first
Things go right, I spoil her first
I give her the world, that's what she deserve
She my lil' rock, she ain't a bird
My numero uno, she can come first


She is my rock, bust at the opp
Hold down the spot, beast with the box

She know how to grind, she hustle like me
Finesse for the check, she get it from me
She don't stay stagnant, she chasing her dreams
When I need a shoulder, that's where I lean
She cute in a dress, she cute in some jeans
She ain't a member, she is the team
When I'm on the go, she know where I be
She is my rock, she is my queen

One Foot,WALK THE MOON,"Not a soul up ahead
And nothing behind
There's a desert in my blood
And a storm in your eyes
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all

Well, I remember the fight
And I forget the pain
I got my hand in your pocket
And my key on your chain
Am I the king of nothing at all?
Then you're the queen of nothing at all


Oh, through the wilderness
You and I we're walking
Through the emptiness
Oh, my heart is a mess
Is it the only defense
Against the wilderness


Cross my heart
And hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other
All that we have is each other
One foot in front of the other

Not a soul in the road
Not a star in the sky
It's a desert in my heart
And I know where to hide
I'm your king of nothing at all
And you're my queen of nothing at all

Well, out here in the dust
If you don't have trust
Ain't nothing left of us
This is the exodus
They're just testing us
They can't flex with us
They can't mess with us
They can't mess with us


Oh, through the wilderness
How come even together
There can be loneliness?
Oh, our heart's a mess
But it's our only defense
To brave the wilderness


Cross my heart
And hope to die
Taking this one step at a time
I got your back if you got mine
One foot in front of the other

King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction


King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, your resentment, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!


I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef

What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give all, king get by, king don't fall

Don't tell me we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
If you really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you


By the way you're talking you would think
You never had any real feelings for me
And if you think I can look across the bar

And see you
In someone else's arms
And I need you
Oh who do you think you are?

No, I don't wanna be friends
Stop telling me, stop telling me, woah

That we can still be friends
Hanging on the weekend
You're gonna be okay if I start seeing somebody new
You hope that I do
It won't be long
Till I forget to call every time that I'm drinking
And you ain't the love song
I can't keep from singing
I gotta be honest
You really believe that's the truth
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you
You never loved me like I loved you",67
Losing Sleep,Chris Young,"Light a candle

I can handle every single curve, you know
That I love you, let me show you, oh


Fall into me, let me breathe the air you breathe
I can take you anywhere you wanna be
When it comes to us every single touch is something special
When we're wrapped up in those sheets
Yeah, we're winning when we're losing
When we're losing sleep


Real life, when it's this good don't you know
We don't need to dream at all
Baby, so...

Diplomatic Immunity,Drake,"Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on SolÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡na show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like SureÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ±os
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

I love, I love
I love, I love it
Baby, I",55

Round Here Buzz,Eric Church,"Another Friday night there's a line of cars leavin'
Home team's got an out-of-towner
Me, I'm sittin' on the hood of mine drinkin'
I'm just a parkin' lot down-and-outer


Under that high school bleacher
I drove that preacher's daughter crazy
Her mama was my homeroom teacher
And her dad was hell bent on savin' me


Yeah, I'm sure there's higher highs
Where the high risers rise
But me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and


Catch me a 'round here buzz

Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here
'Til my down goes up
Lit up like that one stoplight
Across from that welcome sign
Ever since you caught that out there bug
I catch me a 'round here buzz

I never had big-city eyes
Hell, I've never been east of Dallas
Got no idea where you are now
Or if you ever got that penthouse palace


No, Scotty's ain't got no vibe
Got no gas in his neon light
But he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight


Catch me a 'round here buzz
'Cause you ain't 'round here none
Keep puttin' 'em down here, 'nother round here

Greatest Love Story,LANCO,"They said I was nothing but a troublemaker
Never up to no good
You were the perfect All-American girl
Wouldn't touch me even if you could
But you was sneaking out your window every night, riding shotgun in my car
We'd go to the river and find us a spot and we probably went a little too far
Just a little too far


'Cause I was gonna be your forever
You were gonna be my wife
We didn't know any better
Didn't have a clue about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen


So you went off to college and I got a job
I was workin' that 9 to 5
Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin'
Howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back
No it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon

When I was gonna be your forever
And you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed
And we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen


So you came back after a long four years
Your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee
Down on one knee
And I said


I'm gonna be your forever
So baby will you be my wife
Now that we know a little better, we could have a real nice life
'Cause I'm what you wanted, you're what I need
So let's meet in between
We are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen


We are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen

...Ready For It?,Taylor Swift,"Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom

Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever

Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry

When It Rains It Pours,Luke Combs,"Sunday morning
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65


Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea seÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ±orita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours


Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason

That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours


Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out


Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea seÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ±orita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my

Like I was your guy


Oh, then I tried to guess your middle name
For 30 minutes bet we played that game

And you kissed me out of nowhere

Where everything went down

Oh, I told you I was gonna marry you

Untouchable,Eminem,"Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through


Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar


Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar



Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word"" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcause we're black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hatsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂcapped in AmericaÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free"" that made people slaves to build",48

Body Like A Back Road,Sam Hunt,"Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats


Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can


The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets


Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can


We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can


I'ma take it slow
Just as fast as I can (Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed)

Heartache On The Dance Floor,Jon Pardi,"Yeah, I was just hanging out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
So I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
Lke nothing I'd ever seen
Sunburned auburn air
The California dream
Yeah, she was shaking them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say anything
So I sang along


She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?


So I just hung around
This little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closing time
My little mystery
That girl is killing me
So I put on a song
Just to sing along

She was a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, she's moving through my mind
I gotta know her name and I gotta see her again
She's got me wondering, yeah I'm just wondering
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinking about
All I think about, think about, think about


So I'm right here right now
Humming this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to know


You were a heartache on the dance floor
Yeah, you're moving through my mind
I gotta know your name and I gotta see you again
And if you're listening, listening, listening

Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up


Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""


I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow


I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most


I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, ""Bring the studio to everywhere we go"" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's 'cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you",55
Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up


Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""


I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow


I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old


Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go


I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most


I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go",88

Drinkin' Problem,Midland,"One more night, one more down

Giving this town lots to talk about

People say I got a drinkin' problem

People saying that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull another bottle off the wall

But I got no problem drinkin' at all

Drawing conclusions

I call it a solution

The same old buzz, just because

Wishin' she'd come runnin' back, runnin' from the past
Runnin' up the tab, drinkin' for two

Dragged me out on the town, had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't


'Cause I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes, the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you (Never found you)
Never found you


Yeah, I still go out sometimes
But I don't ever try to get that drunk
Now when I can't sleep, it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets
All night keepin' me up
Yeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me

No, I'd have never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to

Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes, the finish line is just the start of something new
If I'd have never lost her
Then I'd have never found you
No, I'd have never found you
Mmm, no, I'd have never found you

And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk

And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot

And you thought that I would let it go and let you walk
Broken hearts break bones, so break up fast
And I don't wanna let it go, so in my grave I'll rot


In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot
In my grave, I'll rot-ot-ot
In my grave, I'll rot

In my grave, I'll rot
I'll rot, I'll rot, I'll rot
Is my pain your freedom?
Is all of my pain your freedom?

Somebody Else Will,Justin Moore,"Been sittin' here tippin' back Crown straight
Workin' up the nerve and the words to say
To turn those eyes and that smile my way
No time to waste
'Cause you showed up and all eyes on you
Shinin' like a diamond in a neon room
Every guy here wants to make a move
I better make a move


Somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now
Offer to buy you a drink
Sit down and tell you your looks could kill
Somebody else will if I don't
Take a chance on your lips
Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else will
Somebody else will


Maybe you're a little bit west coast
Maybe you're a little bit down home
Either way girl I just gotta know
I just gotta know

'Cause somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now
Offer to buy you a drink
Sit down and tell you your looks could kill
Somebody else will if I don't
Take a chance on your lips
Lean in slowly stealin' your kiss like this
Makin' your world stand still
Somebody else is gonna hold you
Somebody gonna get to know you
If I don't get there and sweep you off your feet
Girl somebody else will
Ohh somebody else will


Somebody else will if I don't
Walk up and ask you your name right now

Reminder,The Weeknd,"Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (Pow, pow)
You know me (Know me)

Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you


'Cause you know me (Oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, ah, na-na-na-na-na)
You know me (Know me, know me, oh-oh-oh)
You know me (Know me, know me, na-na-na-na-na)

So, what you say? Put 'em on pause, press play
Hold on, I got more to say


I know my life can get so crazy but as long as you're right here

We can do this thing together
Close your eyes and take my hand
Cause what we have is something special
Baby let's just take our chance
Baby let's just take our chance


Last week I was in Paris with friends
Only thing that was missing was you
Who would've thought we wouldn't be married by now
We been true lovers since high school
Let's live our life, dancin' all night
You are where you should be, I want this for life

So, what you say? Put 'em on pause, press play

She's got a way of changing the game
The way that you play, it's never the same

She make you wanna die for her, yeah
She make you wanna fall
Make you want it all, make you wanna call
She make you wanna die for her


The way that she moves
Is like a soft glow, flicker of a candle
She turns my cool into disaster
Heart is pumpin' faster

She's head to toe, body and soul
So beautiful, she don't even know


She's the kind that makes you wanna
Ride around, windows down
Yell with the radio (She's the kind that makes you wanna)
Drop your plans, drop a grand

Just to kiss her one more time
If she wanted me to

But, I knew this moment'd come, now, it's my time
I got to make up for all them nights that my mama cried
I'm goin' in, I'm puttin' everythin' on the line
Dropped out of school to chase my dream, I had some for to prove
I put my all into this shit, man I can't fuckin' lose
They smile up in my face but they don't know what I been through
Whole lot of nights I went to sleep and I ain't had no food
But now I'm up and I'm just thinking about my next move
Got to keep my head above water, gotta make it through
I do this shit for my mama, and my lil' brother too
Ain't no more problems now I might as well go back to school
Got to maintain, stay on my grind, no, I can't be no fool
Nah, I can't slip, nor I can't fumble, got to stick and move
Get out BR, move to LA, where I ain't got to keep a tool
Surprise, but, I knew my dreams comin' true


We had nothin', stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong, forever right, you know what's up with me, nigga

Just a few days ago I was locked up in them chains
Now I'm in back of the Maybach with a lot of bands
I ain't worry 'bout 'em dissin' now, I don't hear a thing they sayin'
This for my sons and Montana, and can't forget Lil Ben
I never jeopardize this and lose it all again
This for that North 38 Baby, they know I ain't playin'
From the heart, I appreciate all of my fans
This for Monique for loving me and bein' my helpin' hand
I really did it, this for moms, 3Three, Trey, and Aaron
Can't nobody tell me nothin', I'm like, ""What you sayin'?""

In Case You Didn't Know,Brett Young,"I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
And just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't


Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mm, so here goes nothing


In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though, I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know


The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mm
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl, it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking

One of the things that I've been feeling
Mm, it's time you hear 'em


In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though, I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know


You've got all of me
I belong to you
Yeah, you're my everything


In case you didn't know
I'm crazy 'bout ya
I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago

Malibu,Miley Cyrus,"I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand


But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)


We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)


Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah


Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu (Baby)
Next to you (Oh, oh)


We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start, a dream come true in Malibu",78
Bad Liar,Selena Gomez,"I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh, wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room, there's a king-size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want, you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams


Ooh, you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh, every time I watch you serpentine


Oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh, tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (Oh)

With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar


I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear, oh-oh
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush


Ooh, you're taking up a fraction of my mind (Of my mind)
Ooh, every time I watch you serpentine


Oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

First Day Out,Tee Grizzley,"Helluva made this beat, baby


These niggas prayed on my downfall (They what?)
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball


Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Mu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?
With vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle

Ayy, JR, nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened? (We did that bitch, nigga)
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-Boom-Boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball",72

Learn To Let Go,Kesha,"Been a prisoner of the past
Had a bitterness when I looked back
Was telling everyone it's not that bad
ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂTil all my shit hit the fan


I know I'm always like
Telling everybody, ""You don't gotta be a victim""
Life ainÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you


I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go


Had a boogeyman under my bed
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head
Always whispering, ""It's all your fault""
He was telling me, ""No, you're not that strong""

I know I'm always like
Telling everybody, ""You donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt gotta be a victim""

So, I think itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me

I see now maybe thereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs a reason why
I've been through hell and back
Yeah, honestly, it's all made me who I am
Holding on's a waste of time
Gotta learn to let go in life

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes


Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow


I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you


Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you


Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I may end up failing too

You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

Lil' bitch, call me Lil' Fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, it's still lit
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin'
Half a milli' last week, you would've thought I was touring
Niggas tried to count me out, I guess they thought I was normal
They ain't know I was different, I'm like ""Lord be my witness""
'Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Get a pigeon, do division, break it down on my niggas
Fuck they opinions why would I listen, they ain't see the vision
When I had a foreign them bitches know I ain't see them bitches
So I'ma ball on 'em
Magic City, let it fall on 'em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah!
My nigga bail half a milli, he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how I'm rocking, I go on them streets
Glock .40, keep it on me, we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything, just let me know if it's beef
We bring the war, I just wanna shine like my Rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping 60s too like we Kobe, oh
Pushing the foreigns, drive through the trenches (Trenches)
Top of the food chain, head of commission ('Mission)
We wackin' niggas without permission ('Mission)
Never was personal, it was business (Brrrrr!)
Settle down, let it settle down
Couldn't tell me shit when I was broke
Fuck they gon' tell me now?
I'm running round
Glock with a drum that hold a hundred rounds (Brrr!)
If it was ""Fuck them niggas"" then
It's fuck them niggas now, fuck 'em!
Never change on my roll dawgs
'Bout that Cain bang them thangs like we O-Dog
Walk up in a dealer and I pull that rolls off
These niggas said I wouldn't make it like I told y'all
Ahh!",58
1942 Flows,Meek Mill,"Started off poor with plans to own more
Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more
I'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us
Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
Cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her
New Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up
Just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
We started off with zero, now I'm seein' M's
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Now every move I make I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like ""You did it!""
My teacher always used to tell me ""You gon' lose nigga!""
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I get two with it
Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin' for the Glock every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes
I'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
Spendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang
I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika, that's a fact
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet
I know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet
Wins and losses!

They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us


Bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley
Ain't doin' no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty
So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends
.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan
They told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings
Sippin' 1942 like it's lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine
Real niggas in my ambiance, bottom line
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it!

They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us


Talkin', this my cocky flow
Damn Daniel, why you son him? Mr Miyagi though
This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94
Mean nothin' to me, I tell you how it gotta go
Rain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though
Heard that bitch say she cut me, I was like ""ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡adiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ³s!""
In the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes
Young nigga, I turned my Impala to a Wraith
When you get a dollar they gon' hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
Private school for all them babies, now they straight, nigga


They wanna see me fold
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
And I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us",59
Yours If You Want It,Rascal Flatts,"There's one more sip in this bottle of wine
A lonely star hangin' in the sky with a wish left on it
And it's yours if you want it
And this wildflower from the neighbor's yard
A real slow dance in the moonlight dark
This hand in my pocket
Oh baby, just call it
Cause it's yours if you want it


And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it


Half of this rickety front porch swing
Every word of every song I sing
My jacket when it's cold
Oh baby, don't you know?
You've got a place to lay your head
On the other side of my empty bed
And it's just made for fallin'
And it's yours if you want it
It's yours if you want it

And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby, it's yours if you want it


It's yours if you want it


Every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing I could beg, steal, or borrow
Every yesterday and tomorrow
Well every grain of sand on the beach
Every blade of grass under our feet
Baby, your name is written on it
And it's yours if you want it


And every bit of love left in this beat up, banged up, scarred up heart
That's been waitin' on a girl like you
And I know it ain't much
But it comes alive with every touch
Every kiss already feels like you own it
Baby it's yours if you want it

Oh, oh
I swear, every dollar, every dime, every drop of rain, every single thing
That I could beg, steal, or borrow
Baby, your name is written on it
Baby, it's yours if you want",57

Was it really worth it
Cut the grass and all the snakes gone surface
Nobody's perfect
Showed them cash, he kinda made me nervous

4:44,JAY-Z,"Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?


Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome, you make it home""
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said: ""Don't embarrass me"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh


I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; ""What ifÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ""
""You over my shit?""


I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a mÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©nage ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ  trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay


I'm never gonna treat you like I should",73

Every Time I Hear That Song,Blake Shelton,"There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay

We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster


Every time I hear that song
IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and ooh-ooh-ooh
I still think about you-ooh-ooh
I still think about you


ThereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs something in the bittersweet feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment, all I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying, when they played it

One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me

And ""no thank you"" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

Got talked into goin' out with hopes you were stayin' in
I was feelin' like myself for the first time in a long time
Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine


Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart storminÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane


Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart storminÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ

You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane


A Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside


Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'

But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records

Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""

Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore


She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted


She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh",76

How Not To,Dan + Shay,"I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days


But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to


You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you're worth the heartbreak and the regret

But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who

If I Told You,Darius Rucker,"What if I told you about my little nothing town?
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now


What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
'Cause everybody's already tried


Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually


If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway?


What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them

So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do, mhmm


If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
Oh, could you love me anyway?


So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to


If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this is
I don't wanna let it slip away, oh, no, no, no
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway, ooh?
Could you love me anyway?",61

Scars To Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made


And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful


She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothing
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful


No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful


There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing

No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful",80

Gave my mama hundred racks
And bought a iced-out AP watch
And bought a Cuban links just to match
That was voodoo, that was magic
Nigga be cappin', I just be laughin'
That was God, nigga was fastin'
And hidin' K2 in my mattress
Smokin' Tunechi in my cell
That was my twelfth time going to jail
That was my second time going to hell
And back for real but I prevail
Canary yellow diamonds in my bracelets
Same color as my lady
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy Mack
And go half on a baby
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy
Have her walkin' like a penguin
Still finessin', still be poppin' fraud finagling and wangling
And a brand new two-door Wraith
I coulda bought it but I just rent it
Got a brand new big old chain
Got so much sauce I don't need no pendant
Paintin' pictures when I be spendin'
I'm poppin' flo-rhythym on all these women
It's my birthday, just turned 20
And I just went to go see the dentist
Put some stones all in my gold
Know you niggas thought I was gone
Know you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home
But guess what, bitch I'm home
On probation, but I still keep that chrome
Crack a nigga dome
(On probation but I still keep that chrome
I'll crack a nigga dome)
Traded my AR for a sniper, traded my Draco for a TEC
Traded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek
And I coulda got a Corvette, and I coulda got me a jet
And I coulda got me some sex, but I only got me some neck
Traded my ex bitch for a check

I wanna buy my brother the world
But since I can't, I'ma get him a Lex
Ayy ayy, I'm a Israelite my diamonds is real ice
I had to sacrifice to be here, that's how I'm with you tonight
I had to run down with my big Glock 9 to feed my appetite
I had to go through hard times and dark times for me to see the light
Ay, I remember pourin' honey on my rice
Ay, I remember havin' no money, I was livin' in shacks
Ay, you got me fucked up if I'ma go out without a fight
Ay, this my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight

My Old Man,Zac Brown Band,"He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man


He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man


My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man

Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man




My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boot of my old man

You was on the verge of losing her
You was acting like you ain't want shit to do with her
I cut out the bullshit and kept it true with her
That's why the sexual tension is high when I'm in rooms with her
She really the shit, I don't be juicing her
I'm the shit too, that's why I'm so in tune with her
I feel like I'm sewn on ya
I feel like you grew on me
Have I grown on you?
Done fronting like I don't want you
Keep treating me like I don't know you
Back and forth between me and all your niggas
You're busy tonight, that figures
Tonight you're staying in his city
And still I answer your call when he doesn't answer at all
But I want that too, that's all
I need the same in return, that's all

Boy,Lee Brice,"Boy, you're gonna know it all
You'll think you're ten feet tall
And run like you're bulletproof
And total a car or two
Boy, you're gonna hate this town
Wish you could burn it down
That fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
But boy, you're gonna love 17
And boy, you'll do some stupid things


You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you well, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be a boy


You're gonna be so stubborn
You get that from your mother
I already see it now, you weren't built for backing down
And boy, there'll be a small town night
And you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes
And when she's in your hands
You'll think you're a man and not a boy
She'll make you lose your mind, boy
She'll be every reason why

You're gonna drive and kiss
And throw a punch
And grow up way too fast
You're gonna drop the ball
Hit the wall
And break some hearts like glass
I know you will, 'cause you're a part of me
And a part of you will always be...my boy


It's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep
And that face will be the same one in the rearview
The day I watch you leave


But boy, you're gonna come back home
You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two",65
Either Way,Chris Stapleton,"We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due


We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried


We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way


It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all


I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way


We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way",63
Any Ol' Barstool,Jason Aldean,"I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool


I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did


Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone

Bitch, I been in

What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us

Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody love, everybody know, how it go

Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you


I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met


When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met",81
Galway Girl,Ed Sheeran,"She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""


I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl


You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the cÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©ili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl


And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night


She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

When I run out of road, you bring me home

Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us

I'd drive through the night

Tell me that I'm not crazy

Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got

Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew

And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?


Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the 6
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong

Going back there tonight

That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it

Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
WakinÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dawg, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary

Nothings Into Somethings,Drake,"You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?


Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me


Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah


Least, do I get an invitation or something?
A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way",64

Lose You,Drake,"I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you.

No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?


Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child thatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
ThatÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs not respectable all of a sudden?
I donÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic


I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run


Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

YouÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂre talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun

No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale

She's so hard to please, but she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands, play at romance
We slow dance in the living room
But all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone, stroking a cheek

You're a little much for me""

Happier,Ed Sheeran,"Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new


'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah


Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you
(Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
But, my darlin', I am still in love with you


But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you


'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you",80

New Man,Ed Sheeran,"Na-na-na-na-na


I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to MÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¡laga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love

I don't wanna know about your new man",65
Supermarket Flowers,Ed Sheeran,"I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink


Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""


I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""


(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, ""Hallelujah, you're home""",76
What Do I Know?,Ed Sheeran,"Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels""


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me
Just love and understandin', positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sayin' love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's comin', it's a minute away
I saw people marchin' in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people followin' their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understandin', positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understandin', positivity


We could change this whole world with a piano

I'm just a boy with a one-man show

How Would You Feel (Paean),Ed Sheeran,"You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you


We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too



Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too",67
Eraser,Ed Sheeran,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see


I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow


I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser


And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser",60

Hearts Don't Break Around Here,Ed Sheeran,"She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole


Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh, my baby, lately I know


That every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah


She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells, ah
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh

Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
Oh, this, oh, this I know


But every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""

Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old

This Town,Niall Horan,"Waking up to kiss you and nobodyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
ItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
ItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars


And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now


If the whole world was watching IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you


I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met heÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs got his arms around you
ItÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now


Because if the whole world was watching IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you


And I know that itÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs wrong
That I canÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂt move on
But thereÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂs something about you


If the whole world was watching IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂd still dance with you

Bottle tops and the truth spilled
Pull the lever, lay the seat back laughin'
You slippin' off your shoes
While the dashboard speakers sing every word of ""Night Moves""


I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna


I wanna stand with you in the third row
Window booth at a bar
Back pew on a Sunday pourin' out your heart
(pourin' out your heart)
When the bleachers are crowded
When you're sittin' all alone
When the rain is pourin' and you need something to take you home

Let me be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be that song
Oh, I wanna be, I wanna, I wanna


When you're searching the horizon (searching the horizon)
When your eyes look back
When you're standing in the moment
Every life has a soundtrack


Oh I wanna be, I wanna be, oh I wanna be
I wanna be that song that gets you high
Makes you dance, makes you fall
That melody rewinds years
Once disappear, makes time stall
Wanna be those words that fill you up
Pull your windows down and keeps you young
Makes you believe you're right where you belong
I wanna be that song

When the highway's calling
When the bottle's dry
When the sky is falling and you're asking yourself why
Oh, oh, I wanna be,(wanna be,wanna be) yeah, oh",63

Halfway Off The Balcony,Big Sean,"I am ready right now
Uh huh
I look up I don't even know no more
I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more, official shit


I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me


I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
My daddy tell me, ""Stay strong, son
And be the man you have to be
Holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea""
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me


She been mad, I've been on the go, on the road
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
That quote on quote, say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett
I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public, if I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

So disgusting
It's that 3 and a third shit
Straight up


I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy

And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think IÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂm ready to jump out the window

I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, ""Do he love ya?"" The question is, ""Do ya love yourself?""
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but


I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me


I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window


Look, I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth I gotta know
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know

Owe Me,Big Sean,"All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
For ever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line


Feel like you owe me checks, owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply, I got no regrets
You disrespect, disrespect, only time I seen you now's on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to, you got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals, now you back it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do, they didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me, yeah
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya, damn

All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gonna take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line


I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass, glass
Honestly, I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust, I don't wanna have a fake us

But all that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line


My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line


Nigga, you know what's about to go down when you walk out that door
Man, I hope these niggas not out here man, fuck
Big Sean, boy, swerve
I don't...with you
Ok, we see you
New girl, new car
Lamborghini Mercy, ok we feel it
Ayy, is this the- is this like the real thing this time with this one?
Or is this another one of those flings?
Like, you gonna bring her home to mom
Does mom know about this one?We know you're close with your mom
What you say about animal cruelty?
Like do you think they should have shot Harambe or like what?
I mean do you think he was going to maul the kid?
We seen you in the furs man, don't lie",46

Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard

Sleep Without You,Brett Young,"Oh, babe


Never thought I would be like this
Wide awake waitin' on a goodnight kiss
Sippin' ninety proof, talkin' to the moon
Countin' down the hours till its two AM
Never thought I would be like this


But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you


I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe
From the smell of your hair on the pillow case
Even if I tried without you by my side
I'd be dreamin with my eyes open
I'd be tossin' and turnin' all night babe

But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up
I can't sleep without you, no
I can't sleep without you, no, no


I bet that DJ'S playin' your song
And your carryin' on
Baby I love the thought of that long as I know I'm the one you're comin home to


But as long as the night ends with you in a yellow cab Shootin' me a text sayin'
Comin' home soon
As long as I can bet on you crawlin' into bed after slippin' out ya high heel shoes
I ain't lyin' sayin' have a good time
Out with your girls, girl do what you do
No matter how late, baby I'll be stayin' up

Drinkin' Too Much,Sam Hunt,"Pour a drink and take a sip of it
Feelin' like a hypocrite
Couple more and I won't give a shit
I never used to talk, I never used to talk like this


I'm sorry I named the album Montevallo
And I'm sorry people know your name now
And strangers hit you up on social media
I'm sorry you can't listen to the radio
And drive out to the place we used to get peaches down in Pelham
I know you want your privacy
And you got nothing to say to me
But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans
With these songs you gave to me
'Member the first time you stayed with me?
Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMAs with me?
Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me
And I was the one on stage, drunk, barely holdin' on on ABC
Hope your dad still prays for me


Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, goin' down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm goin' down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around

A year ago, I was in a hotel room in Phoenix
Wonderin' if it's ever okay to lie
'Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die
But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life
But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye
Every night, you'd fill the bathtub up
Lie there for hours, put your face under water and cry
I never wanted to be a heartbreaker
Turn your sisters and their friends into matchmakers
I know you think my dreams came true
Since you been gone, singin' these songs are just something to do
The only dream I ever had was you
I hope you know I'm still in love
It's the kind that you can't fall out of


Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, goin' down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
Drinkin' too much, drinkin' too much
Since you been gone, I can't get gone enough
I'm on top of the world, I'm goin' down
I'm gon' drink it all 'til you're not around
(Now it's almost gone)

I know this might seem like a contradiction
And the last thing you need is more unwanted attention
But you changed your number and moved
And this is the only way I could reach you
So wherever you are, turn it up and listen


Hannah Lee, I'm on my way to you
Nobody can love you like I do
I don't know what I'm gon' say to you
But I know there ain't no way, know there ain't no way
Know there ain't no way we're through",46
Immortal,J. Cole,"Awwwww...haha


Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA""

Got a chick, I call her Lola, she feel like the ocean
Like to drink and smoke some doja and I feel like smoking
Plus she good at charming cobras, I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia, she be acting boujee

Got the aura of the Mafia, her friends wish they knew me

Who wants my money? I'll tell you who I don't fuck with
Who's pulling strings? I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck, they be talking like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me, dollars, lot of stock in me
It ain't nothing personal, it's business and I'm a commodity
But honestly, Pop Pop would be turning in his grave
The day I let someone else become the boss of me
When there's a boss of me, I'll be damned


What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all

I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be


I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be


I got friends that say I live a little like Cool Hand Luke
Fast cars and motorcycles, raisin' hell in cowboy boots
But, hey, on Sunday morning, I'll take the back row seat
That's how I'll always be


I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

I'm a fan of chert rock bouncing off a Chevy fender
That feeling that you get that first time she lets ya kiss her
Rusty roofs that rattle when the rain is fallin' down
Handshake deals, fresh-cut hay fields, and hometowns


I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things
That's how I'll always be

Hallelujah,Pentatonix,"I've heard there was a secret chord

The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to the kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah


Well baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a vict'ry march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself

Foldin Clothes,J. Cole,"Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey


I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you


I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you


Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk
(""You soft!"")

I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I said I wanna fold clothes for you
I wanna make you feel good
Baby, I wanna do the right things they
Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you


If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
'Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say ""I love you""
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
""Damn, what's gotten into you?""
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peeking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright",58

Red (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)


Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red


Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Oh, burning red (Red, red)

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)

I can tell from his posture, man, he ain't really like that
Mama told me, ""I don't care if you scared
Go in for the kill, if they try, you better fight back""
We'll beat his ass if he try to throw the folks up
What's all that shit you was sayin' like you was so tough?

Where I'm from, all the killers turn hood legend
And they known through them blocks like Dikembe

Thirty shots'll knock him down like Muhammad Ali

Than lovin' a man who didn't know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn't 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that

I wish you were a better man

I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool


I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this


I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it",73
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"I remember when we broke up
The first time, sayin', ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change""
""Trust me,"" remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We are never, evÐµr, ever getting back togÐµther
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


Like, ever


I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh


I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever (No)

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


We (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
No, getting back together (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, getting back together, yeah (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

I Almost Do (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"I bet this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do


I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I donât
I almost do
I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams, you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do

The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Taylor Swift,"I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you


'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was
We never saw it comin'
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children runnin'
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts


But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you

I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
""Do you know how much I miss you?""


I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
""I miss you like it was the very first night""


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away (Take me) to you, to you
Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)

Stay Stay Stay (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talkâaboutâit
'CauseâI read youâshould never leaveâa fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""


And I said, ""Stay, stay, stay""
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me


No choice but to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life


Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

Holy Ground (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
WÐµ block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for thÐµ first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause, darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you


It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

Begin Again (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do


I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do


And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a WÐµdnesday in a cafÃ©, I watched it begin again


You said you nÐµver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafÃ©, I watched it begin again




And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past


'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end

Forever Winter (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),Taylor Swift,"He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity


I call, just checkin' up on him
He's up, 3AM, pacin'
He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in""
My voice comes out beggin'


All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go


He seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead

I call, just checkin' up on him
He's up, 5AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screamin'


All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go


If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say, ""I love you even at your darkest and
Please, don't go""


I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

I'll be your summer sun forever

All this time, I didn't know
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 5AM, wasted

Forever winter if you go

The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy


Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But therÐµ was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knÐµw

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew


What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

The Lucky One (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now


'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right


Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and, darling, they all look like me


'Cause wÐµ had a beautiful, magic love therÐµ
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


Woah, woah


Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up and for the life of us, we can't get back

Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"You said it in a simple way
4 a.m., the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall


I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

Oh, oh


This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away


In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today

Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""

Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""

I Drink Wine,Adele,"How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied


You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser


So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me


Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true

You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (High tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh


So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me


Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time)
We both will find peace of mind (We both find)
Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind


Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else

But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser

The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?

Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him

To Be Loved,Adele,"I built a house for a love to grow

Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

I'll always yearn if I never speak


To be loved and love at the highest count

It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried


I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing

All his trauma increasin' the damage
Hot shit with 'em demons attractin'

Have you fight in your sleep 'cause you haunted from soul odors, dead body smell

Uh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh-huh, uh, uh
I pray this reefer help me get rid of my demons (Uh-huh, uh, what?)
I pray this reefer help me get rid of my demons (Uh-huh, uh, what?)
Uh, let's go


Stuck in my mind, oh yeah (What else?)
I'm in my prime, oh yeah (What else?)
Taking my time, oh yeah (What else?)
Even though everything feels so fast (Uh-uh)
Losing my mind
But it's okay, it's fine
I'ma just keep gettin' high
Yeah, I'm tryna reach new heights


There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone
There's times when I feel alone

I wonder if anybody knows
I wonder if anybody notices
When I get in my head and feel alone
No, I don't think nobody really notices (Huh, yeah, yeah)
Life don't seem so fair, uh, uh, uh
Devil standing right, right there
Funny, you don't think I see you standing right there?
I guess I'm just too high to care (Care)
Well, at least I found love, that's rare
She helped me move my things from the Heartbreak Hotel
The wishing wells love to splash
And I'm in the electric chair


Stuck in my mind, oh yeah
I'm in my prime, oh yeah
Taking my time, oh yeah
Even though everything feels so fast (Uh)
Losing my mind
But it's okay, it's fine
I'ma just keep gettin' high
Yeah, I'm tryna reach new heights


There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone

Okay, I get it, I understand
There's people here to hold my hand
But what happens when, happens when
I can't comprehend someone holding my hand?
Numb the pain with the drank, what I spent? Five bands
A bunch of pills, Oxyco', spent another five grand
But understand none of these drugs make the person I am
Sober up, I can, sorry, but I can't
Hope to see tomorrow, the potency of sorrows
I was thinking hopefully, maybe hopefully
There's some dopamine I could borrow
It's a long shot from the finish line (Long shot)
So many obstacles in this life, life of mine (Life of mine), yeah


Stuck in my mind, oh yeah
I'm in my prime, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Taking my time, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Even though everything feels so fast (Uh)
Losing my mind
But it's okay, it's fine (It's fine)
I'ma just keep gettin' high (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm tryna reach new heights (Yeah)


There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone (There's times when I feel alone)
There's times when I feel alone

Christmas Isn't Canceled (Just You),Kelly Clarkson,"Out in the cold
Standin' where the trees meet the road
This used to be our favorite spot in this town
Memories with you and me ruin it now (Woah-woah-woah)
That's where we met
Like a winter dream and I bet
I wasn't the first, and I won't be the last
Underneath that mistletoe, you've been so bad (Woah-woah-woah)


You ruined all my favorite things (All my favorite things)
But you won't take Christmas from me


I'll be hanging every light I find in this house
Playin' Christmas music so loud
This year Christmas won't be quite so blue
And I'm gonna shout too much and dance in the snow
Drink just enough to let us go
Christmas isn't canceled, just you


Lost at first
Thinkin' that I might (I might) be cursed
Winter Wonderlands weren't made for one
So we've all been told since we were young (Woah-woah-woah)

But I'm not feelin' incomplete (Feelin' incomplete)
Turns out I don't need a thing underneath my tree


I'll be hanging every light I find in this house
Playin' Christmas music so loud
This year Christmas won't be quite so blue
And I'm gonna shout too much and dance in the snow
Drink just enough to let us go
Christmas isn't canceled, just you


(Christmas) Without you is still fun
(Christmas) And when the New Year comes
Don't you worry 'bout me, I'll be alright
Baby, by New Year's night, ooh


I'll be ringin' in the New Year with all my friends
Kissin' goodbye to what might've been
This year New Year's, I won't be your fool
And I bet you see me out wonderin' what's wrong
Watchin' me have fun with you gone
But New Year's isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Just you

Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't",35
